  It all started when I realized — I’m a golf ball.
  No, I haven’t lost my mind. Or maybe I finally returned to where I truly 
belong—inside myself. That quiet corner where emptiness whispers. Where 
names dissolve. Where faces fade.
  A gloved hand hovered above me. White. Calm. Detached. Not cruel—just… 
indifferent. It wasn’t raised to strike, only to guide.
  And sitting in the club — was Her.
  At first, I thought it was a glitch. No way a miniature woman in black 
lingerie and patent heels could be hugging my fate — a cold, black steel 
shaft. But reality, once again, decided to show up dressed as absurdity. 
She rested her chin on her knees and looked straight at me. Silent.
  — Ever thought, — she said suddenly, without moving her lips, — that 
golf is just a rehearsal for death?
  I wanted to argue — but then the ball (that is, me) wobbled, and I saw 
the black vortex of the hole.
  — You know, — she went on, — you’re not the first.
  And in that moment, I knew. We’re all balls, rolling toward an invisible 
goal. Sometimes we're launched. Sometimes nudged. Sometimes we hit the 
mark. Sometimes we disappear into someone else’s script, lost in the 
grass.
  But the strangest thing? As I flew toward that black abyss — I felt… 
free.
  — The secret is, — she whispered into my mind, — the real game only 
begins after the hole.
  And I understood. The hole was the exit. The club — the world, taut with 
tension. And the girl clinging to it—my illusion. The one I held onto so 
tightly just to stay grounded.
  The ball spun, spun—and vanished.

A Monologue from the Hole
  There was no pain. No fear. Just darkness.
  And in that darkness — he felt himself… gone.
  No name. No thought. No memory. Only a strange, quiet being.
  And in that being — he found the answer. Simple as a breath:
  Death isn’t the end.   It’s a goddamn turn.
  There’s nothing to hold on to.  You made yourself up. Because what calls 
itself “I”  is just a story.
  Death isn’t the enemy.  It’s a door.
  It teaches you how to be real.  To drink whiskey like it’s the last 
time.  To kiss a woman like tomorrow doesn’t exist.  To look someone in 
the eye — truly. Because everything is a moment.  And that moment is all 
you’ve got.
  In the silence — as if the world’s volume had been turned off — he 
understood: Death is always here. But she’s the one who teaches you how to 
live.
  He didn’t know how long he’d been there. A second. A lifetime.
  Then — light. Cold air. The scent of grass.
  And again — this world. Moving. Laughing. Unaware that everyone here has 
already died.
  He sat with his palms pressed to the earth. A cigarette burned out 
between his fingers. A glass nearby, the ice melting slow. He looked at 
his hand. Closed it into a fist. Smirked.
  — What was that?   
        Who knows.
  The ball lay in the hole.  And maybe, so did he.
  One thought flickered through his mind:   
       — Where is She?
