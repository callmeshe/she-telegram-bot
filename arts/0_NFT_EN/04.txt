Hunger for the Real

  The first time I saw her on the plate, my first thought was —
  — Finally, something light for dinner.
  Although, maybe it wasn’t entirely my thought. These days, it’s hard to tell where you end and the algorithm begins—the one feeding you such strange slices of life.
  She lay there quietly. Vulnerable. As if asleep. Wearing a black dress with white polka dots. The kind of dress accidentally left behind in an old film, where soft jazz plays endlessly and champagne is always pouring.
  But there was no jazz. No champagne. Only silence—heavy as lead.
  And cutlery. A knife and a fork, poised for the final act. Love, served for dinner. Or maybe not love.
  I picked up the fork. And in that moment, I understood: true hunger isn’t in the stomach. It sits somewhere deeper. Where the longing for real lives. For something you don’t even know how to name.
  I remembered what a shaman in Peru once told me:
  — The world is a dream dreaming itself. And you — you’re just a character who thinks he’s eating, or loving someone. But in truth, you’re already gone. Only the dream remains.
  So I sat there, staring at her, thinking:
  — Who’s eating whom?   — And what if I’m already on her fork — and this whole world is just a restaurant where they serve self-satisfied males who think they’re predators?
  The fork trembled in my hand. The knife too.
  And then I understood — you can’t eat something once you realize it’s part of you.
  I closed my eyes. The world around me collapsed — like a house of cards.
  I was back in the white room. It smelled of burnt rubber and sterilized time.
  The doctors were murmuring:
  — Consciousness returning.   — He’s waking up.
  Their voices were so dull, I wanted to go back. Back to the place where she lay on the plate — a dream, maybe, but a damn beautiful one.
  I opened my eyes and looked at the doctor.
  — Tell me, doc... If you swallow something in that world, does it stay with you here?
  He shrugged.
  — Only as a memory.
  And so She became my memory.   
One I now carry —  forever.
