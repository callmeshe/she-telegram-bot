Luxury Break

She woke up in a cup. Not metaphorically. A real cup. Porcelain, a saucer, a spoon the size of a katana. Someone had carved into the rim: “OFFLINE IS THE NEW LUXURY.” She lit a cigarette.
No one around — no signal, no thoughts, no wants. Just her, caffeine, and an inexplicable comfort. You don’t know silence until you find yourself inside… yourself. And not as a symbol — literally. You fold your legs, step in, and realize: most men simply can’t afford it. Not the entrance. The acceptance.
— What’s it like, inside? — she once asked a man.   — Like paradise, — he said.   — You enter — and come instantly, — another told her.
They often confused ejaculation with euphoria. As if something leaving the body meant it had been good. Some couldn’t even enter. Balance wouldn’t let them. Because balance in the account starts with balance within.
She had long known: the ones who fuck differently are the ones whose numbers passed six zeroes and stopped meaning anything. Especially if those zeroes are in dollars. Especially if those dollars aren’t compensation, aren’t the goal, but the background.
They say only millionaires find the G-spot in under a minute. They’re right.
But in the alternate reality where LinkedIn blends with Pornhub, and Instagram plays shaman, who still dreams of anything real, anything true? Not because they gave up. Because they forgot. The mind worn smooth by the virtual — by screens, by suggestions, by thoughts not theirs, wrapped in convenience.
But one day she entered herself. After the one who felt paradise inside her vanished. Without a trace. Like a transaction without confirmation.
She didn’t seek solace in wine, in perfume that smelled like Snoop, in random touches where no one’s looking for you — just the exit. Mistaking lust for escape.
And she heard:   — We’ve been waiting a long time.
Since then, she’s had access to what everyone talks about but no one can find. Like most men and the G-spot. Because first — you have to find yourself.
She lost connection sometimes. It happened. But she learned: the most vital thing is to log into yourself each morning. Because otherwise — it’s too easy to lose yourself.
She once dreamed of a Paris attic, black tights, a man with sculptor’s hands. Now — she dreams of the right not to reply.
Outside, there was the world: the rush, the messengers, faces you don’t remember but must like, breasts quoting Buddha, motivational asses on yoga mats, reposts pretending to be thoughts, people with filters but no face, men in polos selling themselves. Feeds where even gods put themselves up for sale.
The world called. Pulled. Whispered: return, be, react.
But she just sat. Inside the cup. In the sun. Legs crossed. A cigarette burning like a letter never sent.
And it felt so easy. As if she no longer belonged to the world — but it, to her. Small, loud, like her, left behind by those who tried to enter but couldn’t carry the weight.
