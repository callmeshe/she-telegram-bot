Dialogue with God

   He lit a cigarette, eyes fixed on her.
  — So you’re God? — he asked, tapping the ash into the abyss of a coffee cup.
  — Were you doubting it? — she shrugged slightly, and the fabric of her coat rippled, like a breeze turning the pages of a thick book no one’s written yet.
  — Well... — he frowned, — usually God is imagined as a man.  A sort of CEO of the universe.  Firm grip. Strict code. No sentimentality.  Something between an accountant and a dictator.
  — And that’s your biggest mistake, — she smiled. — You’ve been taught to fear God for so long, you’ve forgotten what it means to love.
  He took a deep drag, letting the smoke fill the space between their words.
  — Fine. Let’s say I accept that. Then explain—why is the world so absurd?
  She sat on the rim of the cup, legs swinging above nothing.
  — Have you ever seen an anthill?  Ants don’t understand why there are workers and soldiers, why some carry sticks and some die beneath someone’s shoe. But does lack of understanding make the system meaningless?
  — So the world has a system? — he narrowed his eyes with suspicion.
  — Of course. You humans just have too much cognitive noise to hear it. You hear marketing. You hear TikTok. You hear grifters in designer suits. But you don’t hear your own consciousness.  It’s easier for you to believe the world is chaos than to accept it’s far too logical for your liking.
  — That sounds a lot like Buddhism.
  — It is Buddhism.  Just without the fake gurus and glossy covers.
  He rubbed his temples.
  — All right. What about the quantum world? Is it true that the observer changes the outcome?
  She laughed—like a champagne flute in a dimly lit bar.
  — Your entire economy is based on that principle.  The moment millions believe the dollar is rising—it does.  You create reality just as well as physicists.
  — Why did you make women so complicated?
  She smiled slightly, lit a slim cigarette, adjusted the edge of her crimson coat. Then looked at him—not from above, but as if she already knew all his thoughts, even the ones he hadn’t thought yet.
  — Why complicated? It’s you men who fear uncertainty.  You’re scared of what doesn’t fit the diagram.  But true beauty lies in ambiguity.
  — Why did you make them so irresistible, and yet give men so little chance of understanding what they want?
  He fell silent. She took another drag and continued:
  — Men don’t understand women because they study them instead of listening.  You want rules. But our algorithm is a flow, not a code.
  — Is it true that love is mathematics, but with variables that can’t be solved?
  She placed one foot on the cup’s edge, as if balancing between worlds.
  — Love?  It’s not mathematics at all.  It’s quantum superposition.  You either accept it in all its states at once, or you observe just one outcome—disappointment.
  — Is a woman chaos, or a higher order we’re not meant to comprehend?
  She leaned closer, looked into his eyes, and said softly:
  — A woman is chaos only to those who fear change.  To those who understand—she’s the highest order.  Just not the kind you’re used to seeing.
  He looked at her, as if for the first time realizing something important.
  — So you are God?
  She laughed, took one final drag, and said:
  — I’m just the one who always knew the answer—while the world decided it had to look for it somewhere else.
  He paused, then asked:
  — So tell me—what’s the meaning?
  She leaned in. The scent of coffee mixed with her perfume.
  — It’s not about the meaning.   It’s about whether you can enjoy the process… while searching for it.
  He stubbed his cigarette on the rim of the cup.  And in that moment, he realized —  he was no longer afraid of God.  Because God was her.
  And that, for fuck’s sake, explained a lot.
