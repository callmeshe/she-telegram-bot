The Wick

Mr. F. worked as a smoke manager. His job was to ensure the fire kept burning. No one knew why. No one asked.

Every morning, he received a directive: "The fire must burn." It was not up for discussion. It was like a shadow behind your back or the reflex of blinking.
The office had strict order. Some lit the flames, others kept them steady. Some wrote reports, others smoked in them, filling the air with the absurdity of nicotine.

Mr. F. didn’t smoke. He found it ridiculous. But one day, he noticed that the flame of his lighter cast a shadow—a woman in a hat. She sat on his thumb and smoked a long cigarette.

— Who are you? —  F. asked.
— A muse, — she replied, exhaling smoke.
F. frowned. Muses lived in books and paintings, not on thumbs. Then again, by that logic, his job managing smoke shouldn’t have existed either.
— Your fire is too perfect," the Muse said. —  Precise, measured, stable.
—  Thank you, — F. replied.
—  But too perfect a fire is always the first to be extinguished, —  she added, then dissolved into smoke.
F. stared at his lighter. The flame was indeed dying out.
In the office, managers kept smoking and writing reports. The fire had to burn. But now F. knew it wasn’t just his world it sustained—it also held the shadow, smoking on his thumb.
The next day, he didn’t show up for work. The world already had too much smoke without him.

P.S. A steady flame is convenient. It doesn’t flicker, doesn’t threaten a fire. It belongs in fireplaces, in photos for AD, Elle Decor, and interior design blogs. But in a world ruled by those who melt the air, such a flame is always extinguished first—to make way for those who truly burn.
