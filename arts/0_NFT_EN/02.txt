  He sat in the dim light of the bar — the kind of place one visits to 
find themselves, and ends up even more lost. They served a strange 
cocktail here.
  He twirled the glass in his hand, the ice melting slow and silent. And 
there, in the amber flicker, sat a woman. Tiny. Exquisite. Elbow-length 
black gloves. A string of pearls. Shoulders designed for the stage. She 
dangled her endless legs over the rim of the glass, her back arched in a 
way that spoke of pleasure — or longing.
  — Did you miss me?
  — All my life, — I whispered.
  — Then drink.
  He raised the glass to his lips. Spices and something else—something 
forbidden — rose to meet him. And in that moment, he thought: we don’t 
drink with our mouths. We drink with the heart. And every sip is a plea. 
To remember. To preserve. To never let go.
  — You always drink this slow?
  Her voice drifted through the air like smoke. He didn’t answer right 
away. Just watched the amber liquid trail down the glass — and down the 
curve of her collarbone.
  She met his gaze and smiled faintly. A cocktail like this isn’t rushed. 
It lingers — like silk against skin. Smooth. Rich. A dark pour with a 
whisper of sweetness, shadowed by the earthiness of pu-erh, the smoky bite 
of whiskey, the depth of dark chocolate and cracked pepper.
  — Depends on what’s inside, — he finally said, his eyes not on her, but 
inside her. — Some things… you want to drink to the bottom. Because the 
real taste only reveals itself at the edge.
  — Beautifully said, — she leaned back against the rim of the glass, 
fingers gliding over her throat. — But you still don’t know what you’re 
drinking.
  He smiled—just barely. As if he’d known all along.
  — Or maybe… it’s you drinking me.
  He took a sip. Eyes locked on hers.
  The silence between them thickened — dense, like smoke.
  — What now?
  — Now, — she whispered, dissolving into the sip, — you’re one of us. An 
illusion, drinking illusions.
  And somewhere behind the bar, the bartender laughed. He knew the truth:
  The bar, the city, this life, the whole world—one giant cocktail.
  We’ve all been thrown into the same shaker—bitter, sweet, strong, 
fragile.
  And the bartender? Someone. Or no one. Maybe just chance.
  We’ve been mixed, and mixed again—until it’s impossible to tell where 
you end and someone else begins.
  Who tempts who, in this story?
  — Careful, — she said, fingers tracing the rim of the glass. — One more 
sip—and I disappear.
  — What if I don’t want to? — I asked.
  She tilted her head, eyes gleaming like mirrors.
  — Then I’ll stay.
  The glass froze at his lips. The choice was made.
