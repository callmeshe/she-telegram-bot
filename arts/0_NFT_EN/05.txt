ZIPPO SATORI

Dedicated to A.

My name is Andrei, but that doesn’t really change anything. A name is just a label on a folder—inside, there's nothing but emptiness. And one day, while sitting at a bar, I realized I wanted fire. Not a cigarette. Not alcohol. Not a woman. But fire itself.  A metaphysical spark capable of burning this stuffed illusion of life down to the ground.  That’s when she appeared.
A small woman, thinner than reality itself. She wore nothing extra. In fact—nothing at all, save for black velvet gloves, a string of pearls around her left wrist, and a cigarette that seemed to grow directly out of her fingers. She simply sat on the lid of my lighter—an old Zippo engraved with Everything burns—legs crossed, staring thoughtfully off into the distance. Her black sunglasses concealed her gaze, but I could feel it—an icy cosmos behind the lenses, filled with spinning, cynical stars. If you approached her and said something stupid, she would look at you like someone interrupting the orbit of the universe.
But it all felt so natural, I didn’t realize right away that something was off.  Sure, a tiny woman sitting on my lighter in dark glasses—so what?  Who’s surprised by strange phenomena anymore?  We live in a world where some worship blockchain and others—breathing through their left nostril.
— Got a light? — she asked, not removing her glasses, as if seeing right through me.
— You’re sitting on the lighter, — I said.
She smirked.   
— And you’re sitting on your fears. Looks like we’re even now. 
I flipped the lid. She inhaled deeply and exhaled smoke that curled into the air in strange mandalas.
— You do realize you’re not real, right? — I asked her gently, as if afraid to offend.
— Do you realize neither are you?
— Who are you? — I asked, studying her.
— I’m your last cigarette, — she said. — The final attempt to believe this world is more than just a dream.
She removed her glasses, and I saw eyes I’ll never forget.  Because in those eyes was the abyss of every city night, the ache of the cosmos, the hidden meanings of the universe.
— You know, — I said, — people cling to their habits.
— Of course I know. I am your habit, — she grinned. — I’m the pause between you and what’s beyond you.
— But if I light you — you’ll disappear?
— If you light me — you’ll disappear.
— What if I put you out? — I asked.
— Then you’ll put yourself out. It’s simpler than it seems. Any attempt to get rid of me is just another way of remembering.
— So what do I do? — I whispered.
— Choose, — she said, stepping onto the edge of the lid like a tightrope walker. — Burn, or stay ash.
— And if I quit smoking?
— Then I’ll just become a memory.
She looked at me like she knew all my secrets—even the ones I didn’t know myself.
— Want the truth? — she asked softly.
— I do.
— No one is real. Not you. Not me. Not this flame. Just illusions, searching for each other so they don’t go mad alone.
The flame trembled—agreeing.
— Then what’s left to hold on to? — I asked.
She smiled.
— Whatever feels good to hold.
And in that moment, I understood: maybe the point isn’t to light or extinguish, but simply to watch the fire before it begins.  The space between yes and no.  Between inhale and exhale.
— All right, — I said, slipping the lighter back into my pocket. — I’m not smoking today.
She looked at me—and for the first time, nodded with the faintest smile.
— Maybe then, you’ll start living, — she whispered, and vanished.
I closed my eyes. And when I opened them, the bar was gone. The lighter—gone.  Only emptiness remained, and a faint scent of tobacco. Or maybe it was the smell of my life—burnt to the end.
And I remembered —  when I first saw her,  in that very first second, I knew I’d quit smoking.
