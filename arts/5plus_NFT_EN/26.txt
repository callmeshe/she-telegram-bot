Drink Me

I used to think God was some old guy with a beard, — he said, bringing the glass to his lips.
She smiled and tilted her head. The pearl necklace around her neck shifted slightly, like a line from an old book—one you’ve reread so many times, only to suddenly see the meaning hidden between the words.   
Thinking is like jerking off in front of a mirror. Sure, it’s something to do, but the image kinda sucks, — she said, crossing her legs.   
Would you want to be an old man with a beard?   
No.   
Then why should I?
He nodded. It made sense. Just like the fact that she was the size of a whiskey glass, sitting right on his palm, swinging her heel in sync with something only she could hear.
Or maybe God is quantum space, infinitely collapsing depending on where I place my gaze.   
You’re cute. But no. God is what looks out from inside you while you stare into the bottle.
Are you always a woman?   
Are you always a man?   
Not really, but…
He swallowed. She sat on his hand, miniature, like a failed spatial experiment. The glossy Drink Me on the bottle sparkled like a cheap subconscious trick.
Is this a dream?   
If that helps.   
Or a trip?   
If that’s more fun.   
Fuck.
She laughed, throwing her head back. The whiskey in her glass didn’t move a drop.
It’s funny when someone realizes they’re not a person, just a sequence of cognitive templates glued together by ad algorithms.   
Wait, what?   
You think you’re searching for yourself? You just want to be beautifully modeled. A clean brand: Man. Thinker. Seeking meaning through trips, women, cigarettes.
What if I’m not a brand?   
Then you’re no one.
He lit a cigarette. The smoke curled into spirals, like someone’s clumsily drawn aura.
So, you’re God?   
I’m just what’s easiest for you to deify. Today I’m God. Tomorrow—a banner ad for your personalized pain. The day after—a thought you’ll be trying to recall after your sixth drink.
She swirled the glass in her hand, and for a second, it looked like the amber liquid spiraled like a drain.
Do you always speak in riddles?   
They’re not riddles. Just verbal illusions your mind projects onto the void. Funny how people claim they want truth. All they really want is a convenient lie—one that won’t shatter their psyche.
And what’s the truth, then?   
Do you really want to know?
He stayed silent.   
She smiled, tracing the rim of her glass with long fingers.
Look: you drink, smoke, fuck, meditate, take shrooms, read philosophers, stare at the ceiling and ask questions. But here’s the twist—you're not choosing the search. The search is choosing you. You’re not playing the game. You’re the one being played.
And who’s playing?   
Isn’t it obvious?
He said nothing.
So, are you going to drink or not?

He drank.   
Click.
And reality turned itself inside out.
