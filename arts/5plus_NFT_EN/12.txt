Metropolis-X

He sat at a table in the closed club Metropolis-X, where only exclusive orders were served. On his wrist ticked a pair of inverted Rolex, and in his eyes—fatigue of the superhuman kind. The air carried the scent of oil and ozone—the eternal perfume of a megapolis where man was nothing but a cog in a machine long broken, yet unaware of it.
A waiter in black gloves placed a cardboard box in front of him. He raised an eyebrow.
— You ordered the “Cyber Peking Duck,” monsieur.
He nodded and opened the lid.
Inside was something... Not tuna, not eel, not caviar.
Female legs in latex. Fragile-looking—like wasabi, but with a nuclear core within. Everything was perfect: the texture, the color, the plating. So aesthetic, the question of decency evaporated on its own. He looked closer. The difference from seafood was minimal. In taste—especially. In price—also. A delicacy. For the initiated. For those who had already understood much, and more importantly—had stopped pretending they hadn’t.
He lit a cigarette.
— I asked for duck.
The waiter leaned in, just enough for the metal rim of his ocular lens to creak faintly.
— Sir, this is duck. That’s how they’re made now.
He stared into the box, understanding: the city had begun devouring itself long ago. Freder had seen it back in the last century, but no one believed him then. Now, the mechanics had fused with flesh. The streets had turned into algorithms. Art had become consumption, and consumption—art.
He lifted the cyber duck legs from the box, turning them in his hands.
Is she... moving?
— She’s not food.
— What is she, then?
— A reflection.
— Of me?
— Of all of us.
(He slowly sets the chopsticks down. Looks into the box. His face—like stone.)
— The System.
— And who feeds it?
— We do.
(Long silence. The light flickers slightly. The wine isn’t red—it’s nearly black.)
— I don’t want to understand anymore.
— Then you’re almost ready.
— Ready for what?
— For the real taste.
— Very well… Red wine will do.
The waiter retreated into the shadows, and within seconds, a glass stood on the table. Red. Dense. Almost thick, like blood from another century.
He took a sip. The legs in the box shuddered faintly. He raised an eyebrow.
Looks back into the box.
— I used to think I was in charge. Turned out—I was just holding the chopsticks.
The waiter said nothing. He was part of the décor.
— I’ve seen this story before. Fritz Lang. 1927. Metropolis. The mind on top. The hands below. And the heart? It's... in between. Trapped. Forgotten how to beat.
The waiter nodded. As if the System understood.
— Everyone thinks they’re in control. But in truth—we just serve.
He looked at the latex legs in the box. He thought he could feel her.
— I’m not the chef. I’m not even the client. I’m a cog.
Pause. He raised the glass to his lips but didn’t drink.
— Metropolis had a way out. “The mediator between the head and the hands must be the heart.” I used to think—what a beautiful line. Now I realize—it was a manual.
He gently pulled the legs from the box. Carefully. Almost tenderly. As if disarming a bomb.
— You think she’s alive?
— If you still have a heart—then yes.
Silence.
And the ticking of inverted Rolex.
Counterclockwise.
