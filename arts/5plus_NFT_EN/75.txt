Tea Singularity

She fell asleep while brewing pu-erh. The tea table suddenly lost its familiar shape and began pulling her inward. First, her legs grew longer, like the heroine of a French graphic novel, then her leopard coat melted into the background, and her self-awareness drowned in the steaming haze.
Who are you? — asked a voice, crackling like radio static.
I am SHE.
That’s too ambiguous.
And you?
I am the leaves.
She looked down and saw a swirling tea vortex beneath her, in the center of which a man's silhouette vaguely took shape. He belonged more to a leather interior and the roar of an engine, but here, his speed had become hot steam, his reality brewed in a teacup.
Are you part of the ceremony, or its cause?
I’m here until someone drinks me, — his voice steeped into a bitter pause, like leaves that know their flavor is only a matter of time.
She leaned in closer, her lips brushing the mist that curled between them. In the shadow of his face, a smile sparked — the glint of a silver spoon sliding across the hot surface.
Then I’ll drink you first.
He squinted slightly, watching her fingers touch the rim of the cup.
Are you sure you can handle me?
I create flavor. I don’t fear it.
But flavor is an illusion.
She smiled like a woman who knows the secret but isn’t in a hurry to share it.
And you? Are you an illusion?
He stepped closer, and the tea in the cup trembled, echoing the movement.
I’m the one waiting for you to awaken yourself.
At that moment, the tea grew darker, denser. She stared into the depth of the cup, and there, at the very bottom, they were both reflected.
Then the cup flipped — and reality changed its settings again.
