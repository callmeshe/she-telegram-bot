Goddess à la Carte

He ordered her through an app. Not like an escort — like a sensation.
The package name sounded odd: SHE EXPERIENCE / deluxe version.
The description read:
You will receive a being who will either remind you who you are. Or make you forget.”
He wasn’t expecting much.
Evening, fatigue, a week without inspiration.
He just wanted some warmth.
Or a signal that he was still alive.
When the dish was served, beneath the silver cloche — there she was.
Not food.
Not a woman.
Not sex.
A presentation — yes.
A platter — yes.
A body sculpted like marble, but inside — porcelain, ready to crack under any gaze.
Is this a mistake? — he asked.
It’s you, — she replied. — Just translated into taste.
She danced with her eyes.
The waiter lifted the lid gently, as if unveiling a mantra.
On her chest — seashells.
On her feet — nothing.
On her tongue — an ancient code spoken long before words.
He wasn’t sure if he should taste.
Maybe it was a test.
What attracted you to me? — she asked.
The presentation, — he admitted.
Typical.
She smirked.
But you know… there are those who undress a woman with their eyes. And those who undress the presentation to reach the essence. Which are you?
He didn’t answer.
Because his tongue had gone numb from the flavor that wasn’t there.
P.S.
The receipt later read:
SHE EXPERIENCE / deluxe version / Non-refundable. For living only.
