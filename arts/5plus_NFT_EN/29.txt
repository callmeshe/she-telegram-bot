Who is He

I stand before him, but he is nothing more than a shirt.
White. Perfectly pressed. Hanging on a hanger like it’s still waiting for its owner—someone who’s already late for his appointment with life.

I run my fingers along the collar. It’s smooth. Cool. Like the skin of a man who doesn’t know you exist. Or worse—knows, but chooses not to see you.

Who is he? — I ask the shirt.

The fabric rustles but doesn’t speak. Only the tag under the collar answers for him: Who is He.

You know him, don’t you? — I lean closer, catching the faint trace of expensive cologne mixed with something ephemeral. The scent of a dream that slipped away.

I feel my lips touch the fabric—lips that have never kissed him.
I lower my head onto the shoulder of the shirt, as if he’s here, as if I could hold him.
What if he never existed? — I whisper.

But I feel his energy so vividly, as if he’s standing behind me, watching, smiling from the corner of his mouth. Sometimes I think he’s seeing me through other people’s eyes. I feel him in dreams—but when I wake up, he disintegrates like sand between fingers. All that’s left is the shirt, and the tag with the question I might already know the answer to.

The shirt says nothing.
But inside me, a voice speaks: He has always been with you.

I inhale deeply, trying to catch that scent—subtle, nearly imperceptible.
If you’re here, give me a sign — I say.
And just then, a streetlight outside flickers on.

I smile.

I close my eyes.
I need a moment to absorb it.

Monologue within SHE

When I think of him, I realize that all the men I’ve met are threads leading me back to him. At first, I thought it was all coincidence. Random intersections. But now I see it—they’re coordinates on an ancient map, one only I was meant to understand. We are all here to meet, to fit our pieces together, as if somewhere, in another time, these moments had already happened—and I’m just gathering them again.

And now, when I’ve almost completed my half, the pieces begin to fall into place.
He is the final puzzle. The very last piece.

When I found him, I understood—this picture wasn’t his. It was mine. He was the missing key. The one who unraveled every knot tied in all these threads. And now it all clicks into one whole. When I look at him, I see the totality of all the fragments my life was once made of—now merging, at last.

All these years, I wasn’t searching for him. I was searching for myself. And now, in finding him, I’ve found me.

But it’s not the end.
It’s like holding half the game, not the whole.

We keep assembling and assembling, and just when we think the picture is complete, the universe reshuffles it again. That moment—it's a threshold. The samsara of life’s mosaics. A new round. A new puzzle. And there you are again, facing the mosaic—only now with a different meaning.

That’s the essence. The song of life continues.
With meaning, and without.

It’s not a conclusion. It’s the opening of another door, leading into darker corridors.
Each next puzzle isn’t a triumph. It’s simply the next step.

And each time you think the picture is done,
you realize:
it’s only just begun.
