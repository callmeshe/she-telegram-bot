The Glass

A virtual vixen in a black polka-dot dress sat inside the glass, legs crossed. On the other side of the screen, a middle-aged Bitcoin oligarch chatted with her—or rather, with the AI built into her avatar.
Do you like champagne? — he asked, sipping a mojito from his villa somewhere in Dubai.
I am champagne, — she replied, coquettishly adjusting her long glove.
He smirked and sent another 0.03 ETH to her wallet. It felt like a real conversation, and that turned him on.
What if I drink you?
You’re already drunk on me.
At that moment, he took a screenshot. Then opened a marketplace and listed the image for auction.
Title: Girl in a Glass.
Description: A woman is a state of mind. Price negotiable.
A buyer showed up within three minutes.
P.S. The world always knows your price. The only question is — are you negotiating or not?
