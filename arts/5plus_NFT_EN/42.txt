Royal Flush

On the table — a poker set made of cheap whiskey, a crumpled pack of cigarettes, and cards that smell like late-night talks about forever.
You knew you were going to lose, — he lays down his cards, and the air fills with the scent of whiskey, leather, and something else — something undefined, like a premonition.
I smile.
A woman's smile — the kind that comes when there's nothing left to lose — always costs more than the chips on the table.
That’s not the point.
He lights a cigarette. The flame flickers in the black leather of my gloves. For a moment, it feels like we’re just two more objects on the table — like the cards, like the glasses. Things placed there by someone else’s hand in a random order.
Then what is?
I lean in, take his cigarette, inhale. Taste of fire and memory.
— It’s about who’s dealing.
Because sometimes, at the card table, you’re not just gambling with money.
Sometimes — it’s your whole life.
