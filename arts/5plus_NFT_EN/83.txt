Pu-erh in Rostov-on-Don

This pu-erh is special, — said the tea master, wiping the cup with the edge of his sleeve. — Its flavor takes time to unfold, but once it does, there's no going back.
He watched her hanging upside down, suspended by a thread that resembled destiny. Her body was perfect — not by some standard, but in the sense of tea ceremony architecture. Flexible, resilient, it radiated warmth that contrasted with the scalding steam rising from the cup.
Brew her, — the master said curtly, stepping back into the shadows.
He took the thread, lifting her slightly.
Tea doesn't tolerate haste, — he murmured to himself, lowering her deeper.
Her skin touched the surface, and reality cracked.
First steeping
Rostov was humid that day, the air thick and sticky like undiluted syrup. Outside, an argument over bad tangerines. He didn’t hear words, only rhythm — like a distant war drum.
And in the cup, she… was soaking.
Tea opens only to those who know how to wait, — the tea master said, as if reading his thoughts.
He watched her outline soften, her essence merge with the water. There was no more solid or liquid — only taste.
Pour it out, — said the master.
The first steep is always discarded. It cleanses, but doesn’t reveal.
He poured it away.
Second steeping
He lowered her again.
And suddenly the world… bent.
Buddha sat across from him, right on the tea table. Small, round-bellied, with a calm face — as if none of this was surprising.
You again, — said Buddha.
Me? — he asked.
Yes, you keep brewing me — in pu-erh, in oolong, in your thoughts.
What should I do with it?
Buddha sighed.
Keep brewing.
The water darkened. Notes of wood, tobacco, and just a hint… of sadness.
So what are you here to ask this time? — Buddha yawned and scratched his belly.
Why am I still here? Why not where I want to be?
Because the tea hasn’t steeped yet, — Buddha rolled his eyes. — You always want the final pour, but your patience lasts two drops.
He thought about that.
In the cup, she breathed steam, dissolving, doing her work.
Buddha nodded.
You’re looking for your Shakti, — he said, sipping.
And?
Everywhere. In each new one. In every pair of eyes that holds your gaze longer than three seconds.
Is that so wrong?
Buddha smirked.
It’s like chasing aroma by running between plantations. You’ve brewed so many, yet never truly tasted. You keep thinking the next place, the next woman, the next tea will be better.
He went silent.
That’s why you drank ayahuasca, — Buddha said, looking into the cup as if the scent of doubt rose from it.
How do you know?
Buddha gave him a look.
You thought vomiting meant truth. That if you shattered, you'd be rebuilt better.
Where do you get this?
Buddha’s eyes held no reproach, only the boredom of ancient knowing.
I didn’t get it anywhere. I was just in you — when you lay on the mat thinking you’d meet a spirit. But all you met was yourself — and once again, you didn’t understand.
Buddha leaned forward.
You search for enlightenment like it’s a woman you’ll find in someone else’s bed. But truth isn’t handed to you. She comes only when you brew her. Fully. Slowly.
I know everything you’ve steeped, — he tapped the table. — But the answer’s not in the decoction. Not in the new tea, new place, new woman.
He looked at the cup.
She hovered.
Breathed.
The answer is always in the one you're steeping now, — said Buddha. — If you stopped, you'd see that.
He closed his eyes.
Inhaled the aroma.
Rostov was already far away.
