The Player of Eternity

They called him the Master of Hatches.
In nightclubs, at private parties, and even in elite massage parlors, people whispered that he had access to spaces where ordinary people never set foot.
He didn’t sell drugs or weapons — he sold escape.
Are you sure you want to know the truth? — he asked, holding a long wand-like object in his hand, tipped with a chrome sphere.
— Isn’t that the whole point? — she answered, arching her back as if preparing to dive into an abyss.
— Then watch, — he touched the edge of a circle in the floor, and it dissolved into black nothingness. — This is the hatch. The only way to a place without mirrors.
She balanced between two worlds — the one above and the one below.
Her fingers still grazed solid ground, but the world tilted like a pool table after the final shot.
Above her loomed him — the Billiard Architect.
The one who designed the game.
He held the cue with confident ease.
It wasn’t just a stick — it was a tool of cosmic design, extending the will of the Master of Pockets.
He knew the angle, the force, the trajectory of her fall.
She could still pull back, regain balance — but instead, she froze, a ball accepting its fate.
Are you ready?
She smiled.
Her body already moved in a silent dance, ready to fall.
— I was born ready.
He nudged her gently.
No scream, no sound — only wind slicing through space.
He knew that once she went down, she would never be the same.
But there was no other way left.
He closed the hatch, wiped his hands, and moved on.
In this city, there were always those looking for a way out.
