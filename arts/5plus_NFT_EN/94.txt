Caffeinated Muse

He ordered an espresso. But instead of a cup, they brought him a woman. Petite, sculpted like a Heian-era Japanese figurine, with red lips and a look on her face like someone who knows the password to the simulation.
Is this a mistake? — he asked.
It’s a moment, — she replied, crossing her leg over the rim of the cup.
He pulled out a Polaroid, snapped the shutter — the photo came out like a fragment of memory spat from the brain. In the image — her. But instead of a signature, there was the mark of a kiss. Crimson. Like a clearance stamp for unauthorized pleasure.
Where are you from? — He spun the photo, as if trying to find a QR code.
I bring caffeine to the minds of those who’ve been sober for too long. I’m the scent balanced between lust and enlightenment. I’m SHE — and you brewed me.
What am I supposed to do with you now?
Sip. But not all.
Why?
Because a true muse must remain unfinished. Tastiest when still on the tip of the tongue, not in the stomach.
He said nothing. Looked at her. At the cup. At the photo. Then he got up, left the image on the table, and walked away.
P.S. They say, on the back of the photo, it read:
Don’t try to capture inspiration. Sip it slowly.”
