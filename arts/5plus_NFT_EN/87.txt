Call Me. For God's Sake.

She sat on the phone like on a throne. Or rather — the phone sat beneath her. Heavy, black, long forgotten. The kind with a coiled cord that could have strangled anticipation, but instead just played with it.
Her toes tapped a rhythm: “call me, call me, for God’s sake…” — somewhere in her mind. Or the room. Or the universe, which hadn’t refreshed its messages in ages.
He had the number.
He had the hand.
He had the reason.
But he didn’t call.
He stared at the screen, tapped once, deleted. Because he knew — she was waiting. And the one who waits always loses.
And he wanted to be the one who doesn’t lose.
And she — the one who never begs.
So they both sat — each on their end of a cord that no longer connects, only reminds: once, between people, there was a voice.
Now? Just: delivered.
The song started playing.
Old, sticky, stupid.
Call me, call me…”
And there was more truth in that song than in their last two months of conversation.
He froze.
She turned off the lights.
The next morning she sat on the phone like a trophy. Took a photo. Posted it.
