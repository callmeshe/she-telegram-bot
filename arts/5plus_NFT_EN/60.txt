Kitten in a Glass

Are you going to drink me? — she asked, looking up at him from the bottom of the glass.
Do you want me to drink you?
I do. But not all at once. Slowly. I want to feel important.
He picked up the glass and took a sip. Her body swayed inside, ice cubes sliding along her arms, leaving damp trails behind.
You taste good, — he said, lighting a cigarette.
You chose me to, — she smiled.
He hesitated. The whiskey was almost gone, just like the evening. Stay with an empty glass or pour another — that was the question.
She winked:
If you dilute me, I’ll disappear.
He paused. Maybe that’s for the best? Disappearance is the natural state of all living things.
He nodded, drained the glass, and walked off for another round.
