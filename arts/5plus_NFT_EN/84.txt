Candelabrum for the Enlightened


She was the third candle from the left. Once a woman in red, now a decorative element in a giant candelabrum standing in the lobby of the MetaLux Hotel. She didn’t suffer. Candles have no neural connections — only wax and intuition.
The transformation happened the day she received an invite to “a party for those beyond marketing and branding.” In reality, it wasn’t a party but a ritual in a house on Ostozhenka, where crypto-philosophers smoked silence and meditated on spot charts. There, she was offered to light the way for humanity — literally.
The candelabrum was a symbol. The central candle — a former business coach. The right candle — an NFT star who had turned her body into tokenized plasma. And she... she was the light between sex and simulacrum. For every drop of wax, she was paid with attention — and sometimes with Ethereum.
In her past, there was a dress from Yves Saint Laurent and a man whose eyes looked like puddles after acid rain. He said she burned beautifully. She thought he meant her feelings, but in fact, it was her energy. He handed her over to the curators as a gifted candle. And when the wick slipped into her mouth, she could no longer protest.
Every night at 5 a.m., the candelabrum was lit anew. She melted slowly, wrapping the bronze. In those moments, she would hear a voice inside her whisper:
You wanted to be art — now you are fire, flesh, and decor. Enlightenment is just a beautiful death, repeated a hundred times before the auction.”
She loved that moment. It held everything: transience, style, and the absolute absence of meaning.
Candelabrum for the Enlightened. Chapter II – Burning as a Way to Be
When the lobby turned fully dark — it meant the NFT sunset had begun. Guests in black glasses and transparent faces gathered in chairs wrapped in existentialism. They called themselves collectors but were, in essence, hunters of light. They were aroused by form, but it was strictly intellectual — like masturbating with Deleuze quotes.
This candle has a beautiful melting dynamic, — said one, eyeing her like a new idea.
Yes, but she’s slightly post-conceptual. Melting a bit on irony, — another replied, chewing a DAO-shaped gummy.
She listened. She was no longer a woman — more a myth locked in the geometry of bronze. Her dress had become part of the stand, her leg — a graceful twist, her face — the elegant design of a wick. Every time someone posted a photo captioned “light my mind,” she felt a slight burning where her ego used to be.
But one day, something changed: one guest, a guy in a white hoodie that read “I burned before it was cool,” stepped closer than usual. His gaze wasn’t of a collector — but a criminal.
You’re real, aren’t you? — he whispered, touching the edge of her wax cheek.
She froze. Or maybe the wick trembled — she could no longer tell.
You’re not a candle. You’re a fold in time. You’re a woman who burns but doesn’t burn out. You are enlightenment in a body.
He spoke as if reading an auction description. But his voice was... warm. Human. And for the first time in many months, she felt that she might still have a center. Even if buried beneath layers of aesthetics.
He extinguished her flame. Carefully. Tenderly. The candelabrum shivered, as if metal longed to become flesh again.
Come on. I know a place where people turn back, — he said, offering a hand that didn’t exist.
Thus began her way back. From light — to body. From role — to woman. From wax — to desire.
Candelabrum for the Enlightened. Chapter III – The Metaverse, or SHE 3.0
He led her through a mirrored corridor, where reflections trembled like the memory of sex too good to be real. Behind the last glass — no door, just a glitch. A tiny crack in reality where a hum stirred, like the breath of a synthesizer.
This is a portal, — he said. — To the metaverse we haven’t sold yet. Will you enter?
She nodded. Or blinked. Or simply allowed herself to disappear.
In the next moment, everything became digital.
She was reborn in pixels: the long line of fire became the DNA of her avatar, her dress — a stream of particles, her face — a perfect neural network with 98% similarity to herself, but just a bit prettier. Just as she had always wanted. Now, she could be anyone — except who she was before the metamorphosis.
Welcome to Galerium. Here, art lives until it’s forgotten, — he said, and vanished, leaving behind a logo shaped like a hand holding a match.
The world resembled St. Petersburg in three parts: one from dreams, one from snuff videos, and one from a Balenciaga campaign when that still meant something.
On the streets walked women-icons, men-symbols, and no one turned around. Here, everyone was somebody.
She passed a café that served hashtags instead of sugar and turned into a basement called “Burn Club.” There, she met others like her — former art objects. One had been a chair, another a looped NFT footage, a third — a Pelevin quote sold for 3 ETH.
You ran too? — asked someone with a polaroid for a face.
I ignited. Then realized it wasn’t the finale, just a teaser, — she replied.
They laughed. Drank air. Kissed in hashes. In the metaverse, passion was conceptual — but sharper than sex under a lamp.
Soon, she became a legend.
Here in Galerium, she launched her own world — Candela, where every woman who burned in the real world could be reborn as a goddess. No wick. No stand. Fire within — but now on her own terms.
She ignited not for them. But for herself.
And now, if you linger in a VR space just a little longer than usual, you might hear her voice embedded in the code:
Burning isn’t frightening. What’s frightening is never shining.”
Epilogue – The Ash Remains Within
She stood atop a tower made of data and desire. Her hair — a stream of fire. Her dress — a self-rewriting code. Candela was at its peak: women once wax now flames. Everyone who came here gained access to a version of themselves that hadn’t burned in vain.
He appeared like a glitch: suddenly, familiarly, too precisely. That man. In a digital body, a bit better than she remembered. But that was the trap: here, reality always leaned toward perfection.
He smiled the way only algorithms could — vulnerably, as they were never taught.
I thought you disappeared, — he said.
I did. But only as your candle.
The pause was warm. Not from emotion — from server heat.
She stepped closer. They were both programs now, but the memory of bodies lived on in gestures.
You chose to burn, — he said.
Because you chose to watch.
He wanted to apologize. Or repeat himself.
But in Candela, there was no “back” button. Only “release” and “remelt.”
She touched his face. It shimmered — like water in a glass during a noisy dinner.
I still think of you, — he said.
I don’t. But that is my freedom.
He stayed.
Not because he hoped. But because in Candela, even shadows burn beautifully.
And when she vanished from his view, he finally understood true loss:
not when a body leaves,
but when the one who was your light —
no longer wants to return.
