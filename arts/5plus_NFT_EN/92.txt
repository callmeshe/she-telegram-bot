A Lens for Those Who Remember

Smile.
— I don't know how anymore, — she said, and sat on the lens.
He held the camera the way one holds fate: gently, with two fingers, without touching the shutter. Not because he was afraid to press it — but because he knew: one frame changes everything. Especially if she’s in it.
She was a retro-muse. A 1950s painting scanned in 8K. A polka-dot dress. A look that already knew she was about to be erased. The kind that doesn’t fit into algorithms. The kind you can’t retouch.
You know I’m not real?
— Real is what you want to keep.
He looked at her through the lens,
and she — through him.
It was an old camera. Film.
But he knew: only film captures the soul.
You’ll shoot me?
— I’ll make you eternal.
Click.

The world took a step back.
She disappeared.
He opened the photo.
Nothing. Just the lens. And his fingers.
But he knew — she was there.
In every shot that didn’t turn out.
In every glance no one noticed.
In every “not yet,”
that was actually already goodbye.
P.S. She remained in the lens. Not as a file, but as a state — a subtle haze on the inner glass, through which he now viewed the world. He knew: the real memories never make it into the album. They live in the cracks between frames. in the slight shake of a hand. In the laugh she let slip at the wrong time. In the moment he didn’t press in time. But those are the warmest moments. You can’t show them to friends or print them. But you can recall them on the darkest night when you need light — just a little. He closed his eyes — and saw her. Not the photo. Not the image. But the feeling. The kind that softens everything inside. And makes it a little easier to be.
