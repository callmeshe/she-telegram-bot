Expensive Pleasure

She sat inside a giant glass like the final word in a conspiracy against sobriety. Legs stretched out, cigarette smoke curling upward in a thin line—like Bitcoin’s trajectory before its inevitable crash. She wore a polka-dot dress—the discreet nature of reality encoded in fabric.
You think this is art? — the bartender asked, looking up at her.
She smirked.
It’s marketing.
The bartender nodded, as if he understood. But of course, he didn’t. No one did. The glass, with her inside it, had been listed on an auction where value was measured not in meaning but in reposts from private chats. Yesterday, a similar girl had sold for 0.07 ETH. Today, the bid hovered around 0.03. It wasn’t about money. It was about who was the commodity.
The world used to be different, — he said. — People worked, built houses, bought things in stores.
She flicked ash into the glass.
People still buy things. Only now they don’t exist.
And it was true. NFTs replaced paintings. Crypto replaced money. Emotions were swapped for algorithms. Love—replaced with mechanisms for capitalizing desire. Everything had become tokenized, even loneliness. Especially loneliness.
The bartender poured himself something amber, even though alcohol had been banned in the city for years. Everything was forbidden. But nothing ever stopped.
She slowly looked at the man sitting at the bar.
What do you think? — she asked.
He smirked and pulled a coin from his pocket—a real one, metal. It gleamed under the dim light.
See this? — he placed it on the bar. — It had a price once. But no one cares anymore.
She traced her finger along the rim of the glass.
So what do they care about?
He flipped the coin with lazy intrigue.
Only what can’t be bought.
She took a drag and exhaled, watching the smoke melt into air. Then she pulled out a napkin, pressed her lips to it—leaving a mark red as a Chinese yuan—and dropped it into the bottom of the glass.
Then I’d rather be an expensive pleasure.
