Moscow stories

Evening, soaked in the scent of expensive perfume, blended with the flicker of neon signs.
We wandered through TSUM like it was the Tretyakov Gallery — examining, analyzing, pretending we were just about to buy. We had no money, but we couldn’t afford to seem poor either. After all, all those coaches had taught us: “Live as if you already have it all.”
I turned my head and said,
A restaurant sounds good right now, — I said, dragging out the words — the perfect end to a birthday.
The universe decided it was time to back theory with practice.
A man was swaying right toward us.
White shirt, three buttons undone, a belly, the smell of expensive cologne applied with no regard for subtlety.
Zelensky! — he shouted. — Zelensky, f***!
I instinctively knew he wasn’t talking about the president.
Most likely, the perfumer. And his soapy empire.
He stopped dead in front of us, pulled a roll of dollars from his jeans — thick like the toilet paper in old Soviet hotels.
Unrolled it, peeled off a few bills and casually began stuffing them into my purse.
The purse was zipped, but I unzipped it just as smoothly and precisely as a man putting on a condom in the dark — one fluid, well-rehearsed motion, as if the scene had been storyboarded in advance.
You, — he said to my friend, repeating the same move.
Then he turned and disappeared into the night like a simulation bug quickly patched before anyone noticed.
We stood there, looking at each other like characters in a video game, just handed a side quest and loot by a rogue NPC.
The money was real.
This is Moscow. That’s just how it goes here.
So, restaurant? God heard us. Sent him.
Somewhere up above, the programmer running this level of the simulation took a long drag on his cigarette.
P.S. Based on true events.
The world of simulacra sometimes glitches — and when it does, random money generators walk the streets.
Just don’t forget to keep your purse unzipped.
