Bon Appétit

You chose us, — whispered the burger. — You could’ve been anywhere, but you’re here.
She ran her tongue along her teeth, feeling hunger. Not physical. Deeper.
She didn’t remember how she ended up in this strange place, but she knew: the choice had already been made. On the table in front of her lay different versions of life, neatly packaged in glossy boxes. One — a life in Paris, with morning baguettes and lighthearted novels. The second — a brilliant career, flawlessly arranged like an expensive suit. The third — a family, ideal but flavorless, buried in routine and mediocrity, like a dresser with a top drawer that no one opens anymore.
Why you? — she asked, looking at him.
Because I’m the choice without a choice, — he answered. — I’m marketing zen. I’m the answer when the question is too scary. I’m your weakness, your way to dodge all the wrong questions. I'm not eaten — I just fill the emptiness.
She touched the bun with her finger. Hot. Smelling of salt, grease, and capitalism.
She closed her eyes and heard, somewhere in the distance, the waiter’s voice:
Your order is ready.
But did she ever order this? Does anyone ever really order their fate? Or just pick from what’s already on the menu?
She leaned in closer and suddenly realized: she now had two options. Either get up and leave, leaving the meal untouched. Or open the box and finally take the first bite.
Somewhere deep inside her, appetite was already stirring.
Bon Appétit.
