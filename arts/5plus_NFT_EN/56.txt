NFT EXPRESS. SHE: All or Nothing

He ordered a cocktail.
Strong but sweet, — he told the bartender, trying to sound like someone who knew what he wanted.
The drink arrived on a silver tray. Something inside it stirred.
What’s this? — he asked.
The bartender nodded toward a card beside the glass.
NFT EXPRESS. Exclusive subscription. You did select the “female version,” correct?
He looked at the woman in the glass. Slim legs in black stilettos, dark hair, bare shoulders. She lazily wrapped her arms around a cocktail pick, like a pole she was dancing on in some parallel world.
The waiter continued:
SHE is the quintessence of feminine consciousness, dissolved in culture, desire, and mirrored mazes of perception. She’s not just an image — she’s an algorithm, designed by nature and sculpted by centuries of art.
She’s the divine intelligence of a woman — but without sentimentality. She’s not a goddess to be worshipped, but a system to be hacked. Though only a few have ever succeeded.
SHE is art that looks back at you. An art-consciousness that generates form, meaning, and mistakes you mistake for fate.
SHE can be purchased — but never owned. Understood — but never explained. Near — but always out of reach.
SHE is a question you will never have a final answer to.
Does she speak?
Only if you buy her.
He took out his phone, opened his wallet.
How much?
Depends what you want.
He looked at her.
What can she do?
The woman in the glass smiled.
I can become your desire, — she said.
The bartender nodded in understanding.
The basic subscription includes intrigue, a hint of irony, and light flirting. The full version — that’s exclusive content. You can choose scenarios.
Like what?
Love. The illusion of choice. Even existential crisis. But the most popular one is: “You thought you bought her — but actually, she bought you.”
The man hesitated.
And how much for the full package?
The woman in the glass laughed, tilted her head, and slowly traced a finger along the rim of the glass.
Everything you have, darling.
He finished his drink. And nodded.
