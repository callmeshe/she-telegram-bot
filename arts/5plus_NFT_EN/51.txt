Espresso Reflections

She lay inside the espresso cup, arms stretched wide as if sunbathing.
The bitter aroma soaked into her skin, and a soft tang of morning melancholy bloomed around her.
There was a ritual to it — dissolving into coffee, becoming part of it.
She thought about how life was just a sequence of random encounters and half-made choices no one wanted to own.
Everything would be easier if a day could be lived like a night in a hotel:
no attachments, no consequences, no promises for tomorrow.
You drink the espresso, leave a trace of lipstick on porcelain —
and that mark is the only proof you ever existed in that moment.
And that was okay.
All she needed was more coffee, and even less regret.
Sometimes she felt like an extra in someone’s surreal dream,
her life nothing more than background for something that mattered more.
People played at seriousness, competed for meaning —
but if you really listened, their words fell apart.
She lit a cigarette (mentally, of course) and took a sip.
Life was full of these tiny signs, if you paid attention.
People thought they were making choices —
but the decision had often been made long before.
She placed the cup down and smiled.
Breathed in deep, letting the scent of burning time pass through her.
None of this made sense.
Which is exactly why it did.
Coffee wasn’t just a drink.
It was a litmus test of the soul.
You could say whatever you wanted —
but your choice between espresso and latte said more than any therapist ever could.
If Coffee Were a Man
Americano — “The One I Trust”
No games.
He arrives — black, direct, no foam, no words.
He lives in the exhale, makes no effort to impress,
but moves like a man who knows the way, even in the dark.
She trusts him.
With him — silence doesn’t feel empty.
Espresso — “The Predator with a Cold Heart”
Minimalist in form.
Straight posture. Porsche keys.
Few words — and not a single mistake in tone.
He doesn’t promise. He delivers.
Hot. Bitter. Honest.
SHE never calls him. He finds her.
Cappuccino — “The Light-Scene Actor”
He seems soft.
Seems gentle.
He plays the part of tenderness, but you feel it —
inside, he’s espresso, just hiding behind the foam.
He might believe in astrology.
He might seem like a romantic.
But SHE doesn’t buy performances.
Latte — “Not Fully Grown”
He wants to love.
Wants to be “the one.”
But chooses warmth and simplicity.
He takes selfies. He’s never in a rush.
He says, “One day.”
SHE listens — and moves on.
Flat White — “Too Perfect to Be Real”
He knows balance.
He listens well.
He’s made for long talks in white interiors.
And it would be perfect —
except SHE doesn’t trust perfection.
She knows: where it’s flawless, there’s no pull.
Raf — “The Sweet Excuse”
He fears reality.
Hides his fear in cream and dreams.
He’s fine — but only on his own.
And SHE doesn’t get angry. She just leaves,
while he writes another motivational post.
Decaf — “Emotionally Zenned Out”
He’s there — but flavorless.
Says the right things.
Quotes Buddha.
Manages his cortisol and avoids chaos.
SHE knows — with him, her heart won’t race.
Which means — he’s not hers.
Turkish Coffee — “The Ghost from the Past”
He smells like Istanbul, thick grounds, old tales.
Speaks in riddles. Makes no plans.
One day he disappears — just like that.
SHE remembers.
But never returns.
So, tell me about you. Which coffee do you choose?

If Coffee Were Her
(and she was)
She is Americano.
Black, straight, no foam.
Those who know — never ask why.
With her, everything is real. Simple. True.
She needs no extras. She is the flavor.
SHE drinks herself to remember who she is.
Everyone finds it easy to be with her.
But she doesn’t find it easy to be with everyone.
Sometimes — Espresso.
Like a truffle: dense, rare, for those who know how to savor life in small doses.
Aged.
One sip — no words needed.
Because she knows how to live with less,
she’s never afraid of silence.
Filter — if she ever was that. Sometimes.
She’s not an everyday brew.
And certainly not for everyone.
Filter coffee is like a woman.
Flavor always shifts.
Depends on the roast, the method, the heat,
the words spoken in the morning.
On who brewed it — and how they felt.
Sometimes citrus.
Sometimes bitter.
Sometimes she unfolds slowly, like a body in love.
But to anchor herself — she always comes back to Americano.
Because Americano is who she is
when she remembers who she is.
Flat White?
Sometimes.
When she craves warmth without losing style.
It’s like a white shirt over bare skin.
Perfect balance between power and tenderness.
But only when the day asks for softness.
Cappuccino. Latte.
Pretty in the photo.
But the flavor? A fiction.
Foam, expectations, sweet promises.
That’s not her.
Too much milk — and the taste of life fades.
Syrups?
No. Never.
That’s for those who haven’t had sex with a millionaire in a while.
Or did — but didn’t enjoy it.
SHE loves an honest flavor. No disguise.
Decaf?
Sometimes.
When she needs silence inside.
To focus.
But after a few sips —
she always remembers:
coffee’s whole point is the coffee.
And then — the cup.
It’s like lingerie on a woman.
The scent, the tease, the tone.
Black ceramic — yes.
Classic white — always.
Red — if she wants to turn up the heat.
Overdoing it kills the sex.
She knows where the line is.
That’s why her taste lingers — longer than the coffee itself.

And if it’s served in a to-go cup —
let it be white,
with a cardboard sleeve
and a black lid.
No gimmicks.
Just like her.
