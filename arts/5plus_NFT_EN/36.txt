GOD IN ZEGNA SHOES

She met him at the Saint-Germain crossroads.
He was leaning casually against a traffic light, lighting something that didn’t look quite like a cigarette.
A fine tweed blazer, sleek hair, and shoes so polished it seemed the world reflected in them—though it preferred not to look.
Who are you? — she asked.
— God, — he said, flicking ash straight onto the asphalt.
— Which one?
— Personal.
She hesitated.
As a child, they told her God was abstract—draped more in clouds than in Zegna.
But her intuition whispered that expensive shoes were a far more reliable sign of divine origin than thousands of years of interpretation.
Okay, then what's the secret of existence?
God smiled and stepped closer.
Everything you're afraid of was made up by marketers.
Everything you want has already been bought by someone else.
Everything you love is temporary.
What about me?
— You’re a footnote in someone else's life.
She looked down at his shoes—and suddenly realized she was already standing on them, balancing like a tightrope walker.
So what do I do now?
— Live. And don’t fucking flinch.
God turned and walked off toward a dark alley.
She watched him disappear, then pulled out her phone and checked her card balance.
Unlimited.
That meant everything was fine.
