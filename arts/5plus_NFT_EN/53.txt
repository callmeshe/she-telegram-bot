Espresso for the Lost Souls

She woke up in a cup of espresso.
The coffee grounds slowly sank to the bottom,
leaving behind thick, tangled patterns of fate.
Her fingers, wrapped in black gloves, lazily traced the smooth porcelain,
and her lips trembled slightly —
perhaps from the cold,
perhaps from the realization
that it was morning again,
reality again,
the same old choice again:
leave the cup —
or take one more sip.
The barista in her mind —
a tiny Buddhist monk with a tattoo that read “10% off karma” —
silently kept pouring infinite doses of caffeine into her consciousness.
She stretched her neck and looked up.
The rim of the cup was somewhere far above,
in the sky,
beyond comprehension.
Somewhere up there,
successful women in perfectly tailored coats
were sipping smoothies,
rescheduling their lives
from one digital square to another.
Hey, you good down there? — a voice called out.
She turned.
In the neighboring cup, waist-deep in latte,
sat a man.
Grey suit.
Shreds of lost confidence in his eyes.
He looked like an ex-investor
who had gone all in on the wrong coin.
Not really, — she replied. — How long’ve you been here?
An eternity, — he said, nodding at the edges of his cup.
At first it was energizing, but then…
Every time I tried to get out,
the barista just poured in more espresso.
She nodded.
The story was painfully familiar.
Cups with people were scattered all around.
A cappuccino with a girl
procrastinating her own existence.
An Americano with a man
who always had “one last important thing to do.”
A flat white with someone
who was forever “online.”
She stared into the surface of her espresso.
What if we just stand up and leave?
The man shrugged.
Some tried.
They say there’s nothing out there.
Yeah? — she smiled. — Perfect.
She took a deep breath.
Summoning every cell in her body,
she rose.
Coffee slid off her skin,
dripped from her fingertips,
leaving behind the scent
of bitterness and outdated decisions.
She stepped beyond the edge of the cup —
and reality tore open
like cheap Prada seams on a Chinese knockoff.
Now, the café had one cup less.
