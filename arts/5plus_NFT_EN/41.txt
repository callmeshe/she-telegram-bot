F/1.4 or the Secret Meaning of Short Skirts

The photographer lit a cigarette and squinted through the viewfinder.
A woman stood on the lens, like an ascended goddess from a billboard, her red skirt with black spots rising like the wings of a ladybug.
— Brilliant, — he muttered, then fell silent.
She turned and smiled — and for a moment, he felt like a fly caught in a web.
— Did you call for me? — she asked.
Her voice was strange, as if it spoke not from outside, but directly inside his head.
The photographer fumbled for his camera.
— How did you… get there?
— I’ve always been here. You just didn’t notice.
The woman stepped forward slowly. Her heels didn’t slip on the glass of the lens — which, in itself, defied logic.
— Tell me, — she said, tilting her head. — What do you see in there?
He swallowed hard.
The viewfinder showed Paris.
Evening Paris, bathed in light, with noisy terraces spilling out laughter, wine, and roasted chestnuts.
Only… he was in Moscow.
What the hell…
She laughed softly.
— And you thought the lens just shows the world? It creates it.
He yanked his eye away from the camera.
Paris disappeared.
He was back in his dusty workshop, cigarette trembling between his fingers, heart hammering in his chest.
There was no one on the lens.
Damn optics… — he exhaled.
