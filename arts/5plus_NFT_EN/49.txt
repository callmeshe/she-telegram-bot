Bloody Cherry

He ordered a Bloody Cherry—the bar’s signature cocktail, whispered about in the darker corners of the city.
The bartender nodded, like he already knew, and within a minute, the glass was there.
Inside—among shards of ice and shimmering reflections—lay a girl.
Miniature. Weightless. Curved like the last breath of a tired courtesan’s heart.
Her legs, wrapped in stockings darker than his thoughts, long as continental borders, touched the cold glass.
In her fingers rested a cherry—dark, glossy, like a lunar eclipse.
What is this? — he turned the glass slowly, watching her.
The bartender looked at him as if he’d just asked what color the sky was.
— It’s a cocktail.
— Is it… safe?
The bartender sighed.
— For you, or for her?
— In general.
— In general—no. But that’s not why you’re here.
Aged pu-erh. Cherry juice. Single malt whiskey...
It’s not just a drink. It’s a choice. Make it consciously.
The girl in the glass opened her eyes and gave him a slow, lazy smile.
You’re staring too long, — she whispered. — This cocktail doesn’t like the hesitant.
He took the first sip.
The liquid burned his throat, leaving a taste of foggy evenings and borrowed stories.
Then he set the glass down and leaned closer.
There was something familiar in her gaze.
A face from the past, maybe. A dream.
Or maybe just the echo of his own emptiness.
She reached up, hooked her finger around his tie, and tugged.
In the next moment, the glass was empty.
The bartender took it without a word.
He felt a strange lightness—like something inside had vanished,
leaving only a dry shell behind.
He glanced at the mirror behind the bar—
and realized his reflection was gone.
Another? — the bartender asked, polishing the glass.
He nodded.
