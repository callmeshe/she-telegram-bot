Gravitational Control

When he first invited her to the bar, she thought it was a sign. The universe pulled a card from its sleeve, and his number was on it.
Do you drink whiskey? — he asked when they met.
She didn’t like whiskey. She drank it when she wanted to feel like someone else. A noir heroine. A woman who could keep her cool and smoke long cigarettes without coughing.
Only if it’s with mint, — she replied.
He looked at her like he’d just understood something important. She watched the way he moved. How he adjusted his cuff, how he lifted the glass to his lips. He didn’t look like a man who drank for pleasure. More like someone who drank for control.
Have you ever felt like someone’s pulling your strings?
She smirked.
Depends who’s holding them.
Whiskey melted reality. They stepped outside, and the air smelled of electricity.
In his apartment, it smelled of leather and something bitter.
I want to show you something.
He opened a box. Velvet ribbons slipped between his fingers like snakes. She looked at him and felt something stir inside her. She liked that feeling. She knew what it meant but still let him tie them around her wrists, her ankles, her neck.
Now you can fly, — he said, and nudged her forward.
She swayed, and time broke off. She hovered on the edge, and far below, the city shimmered — buzzing, vibrating, filled with other people’s lives. The streets turned to thin lines, the buildings into chessboard squares. The mint whiskey dissolved in her blood, and she no longer felt human.
She looked down and thought: If he lets go, I’ll crash.
But he didn’t.
Do you feel it?
She closed her eyes.
She felt it.
And for the first time in a long while — she lived.
