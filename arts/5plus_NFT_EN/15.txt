The Fish

When he boarded the plane after their first night, the sky still hadn’t realized what had happened. Neither had she. But somewhere in the space between her ribs and his hands, a mechanism had already started spinning—one that couldn’t be stopped.
— Met a little fish, — he said later, stretching lazily on the bed when she finally flew out to him.
— A fish?
— Yeah. Fucked her.
Her inner voice froze. It was the kind of moment when someone else might have faked outrage, put on a show, slammed a door. But she didn’t want to be someone else. It’s a game, she told herself. Either you play—or you leave.
I chose to play. But in that moment, something inside her collapsed irreversibly.
He was smoking. The air in the room vibrated with the warm electricity of his skin. She looked into his face as if trying to read the instructions for this new reality.
— And? What was she like? — I asked. — Wet, — he smirked.
She smiled back. Not to seem cooler than she was. But because it was beautiful. Because it was honest.
Here, in his space, the meanings drilled into her didn’t exist. There was no you can’t do that, no this is wrong. There was only the current of life, where no one promised anything— but no one tried to hide their tracks, either.
And that was more arousing than any lie about there was no one else.
The fish stayed somewhere back there, in the tail of his plane, framed in the window of another life. She didn’t ask for details. Didn’t memorize names.
Only his voice remained— light, unburdened, shamelessly honest. And her decision: either you play—or you leave.

Since then, something inside her would always tremble at the sight of tiny fish in teacups at Chinese tea ceremonies. Small. Silent. Almost ornamental. And at fish served at nearby tables—especially when whole, with eyes. As if someone else was still watching. And knew. They meant no harm. They just reminded her. Of where it all began. Of that moment — after which there was no way back.

P.S. Based on true events. Unfortunately.
