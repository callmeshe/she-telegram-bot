Muse for Breakfast

A room in an old hotel on a hill. No neon outside — only Italy. Weathered shutters, grapes curling along the balcony, and the smell of fresh bread drifting in from the street. The town below didn’t move in the rhythm of a metropolis, but in the breath of a woman.


Someone was walking a dog, someone was placing a rose on a woven café table. Here, in this morning, everything was different. Time moved slowly. The coffee smelled like philosophy. And the sheets were white, like absolution.
She lay on a silver tray, her chest covered by a thin slice of baguette.
He sat across from her, wearing a white robe, an espresso cup in hand.
— I knew I’d find you, — he said, lazily sliding the knife along her thigh.
She smiled.
They had met the night before, like beasts in the jungle — no words, just scent. Two wild creatures who had survived silk and marble, tasteless dinners and empty conversations. He had always known: a true muse doesn’t just inspire. She dissolves into you, seeps into your bloodstream, becomes a necessity.
Now he ate her every morning. Slowly. Savoring.
She reached for a glass of champagne, feeling the fork trace her skin.
— I will be inside you until the end, — he said.
— I know, — she replied.
