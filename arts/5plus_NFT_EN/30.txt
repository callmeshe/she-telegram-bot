Buy Me

He bought the shoes in a boutique on the outskirts of Tokyo.
Expensive. Leather. Wine-colored.
The saleswoman kept insisting they were the season’s finest, but he knew—
they had chosen him.

The shoes lay on a glass display, catching the neon light with a predator’s gleam.
He picked them up and felt something stir inside.
Inside, there was a woman.

She sat curled in the curve of the pump, adjusting her hair in a tiny mirror. Black lingerie. Garter belt. A thin collarbone tracing across soft shadows.
She moved like a slow-motion film.
Didn’t ask who he was.
Wasn’t surprised.

You bought me, didn’t you? — she asked, coloring her lips with lipstick.
I bought the shoes, — he said, but his voice wasn’t certain.
Isn’t that the same thing?

He said nothing.

Shoes don’t belong to the ones who wear them.
They belong to the ones who take them off, — she added, stretching inside the shoe like a cat in a sunbeam.

Suddenly, his fingers felt weak.
The fingers holding the delicate straps no longer felt like his own.
The world narrowed to just these two shoes—and the woman inside.

Who are you? — he asked.

She looked up at him with the soft regret of someone who already knows the ending.

I’m the one you’ve always wanted to slip into.
But now—you’re inside me.

He looked down.
In the lacquered leather, he saw his reflection.
Small. Distorted.
As if he himself had been swallowed by these damn shoes.

And the woman…
She just smiled
and closed the mirror.
