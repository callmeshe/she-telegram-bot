Irreversible

What do you mean, I’m in the cup? — she asked, studying the white porcelain around her.
The naked man in a tuxedo, holding her in his palm, tilted the cup slightly. The hot liquid rippled around her, not burning — just leaving a strange, almost weightless sensation on her skin.
— You’re not in the cup, you’re in the concept, — he said, his voice echoing both inside and outside her mind.
Nadya traced her finger along the inner wall.
— And if I jump out?
— Then the concept breaks. And you’ll either become something more. Or nothing at all.
Not the best deal, if you really thought about it. She looked down — through the black surface of the drink, something moved. Maybe her reflection. Maybe something else.
— So what am I supposed to do?
— Enjoy it. You’re part of the morning ritual.
She smirked. In her old world, she drank coffee to wake up. Now, coffee drank her — to exist.
Far off, the sound of a spoon striking the rim of a cup rang out. The world trembled slightly.
— They drink me, again and again, — she thought, — but I remain.
Just like people drink each other — with words, judgment, indifference. Greedy gulps that leave nothing but emptiness.
But coffee doesn’t stop being coffee, even when the cup is empty.
And neither did she.
No matter how many sips were taken — she remained.
