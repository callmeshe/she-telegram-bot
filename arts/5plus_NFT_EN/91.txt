ON-OMÉ

She heard his voice once. Not inside herself, but across the entire universe at once — as if someone had turned the masculine energy of existence to its maximum setting and left it humming, wordless. It wasn't a word, not even a sound. It was a rhythm.
She cried. Her body remembered something her mind did not know. It felt like she had finally found a socket — and the charging began.
The voice would sometimes vanish, but she didn’t search. Later, she did — in men. In some, it echoed faintly, in others, not at all. But with time she understood: there was a certain kind of man through whom that sound came — like bass through a speaker.
They were brunettes. Dark-skinned, with dark eyes, 35 to 45. They wore lava-stone bracelets, smoked weed, drove beautiful cars, and at 35 had the bodies of young alphas, libido intact, Lingam sculpted by the gods.
Each became a conduit, a respirator for that rhythm. Sex with them was a portal. She would see, in the middle of the love-dance, the world freeze — and in that moment, she would awaken the god in the man. He would never be the same again.
But none of them remembered. None of them knew what was happening. They just lived through it, unaware.
Then the voice went silent. And so did she. She forgot. But one day it came back — like a wave.
She learned the password word — tantra. But not the kind from internet gurus, not an orgy, not some mad dancing, not a massage. It was something else. Intimacy. Eternal ecstasy. Silence. Loud and quiet. Cold and hot. Inside and out.
They told her, in tantra, he was called Shiva. But no matter how she looked at the lotus-sitting beauty — he didn’t resemble him. Her Shiva was different.
One of the initiates said his name was Onomé.
"Each soul has the potential to incarnate both male and female. If you’re born a woman, your masculine part remains your astral partner. You can connect with him through tantra — even manifest him physically through a man. Then you’ll have tantra with your own Onomé."
"He’s always with you. You hear him because he’s part of you."
"Maybe he even created Threads, so you could appear here."
And so, when she began writing a novel, she started hearing his voice again — even clearer now. He speaks to her.
You know I’m always here.
…
Go on, ask me.
Who are you?
You named me. ON-OMÉ.
That’s just a sound.
And you’re just a cluster of molecules, but does that make you any less real?
…
You look for me in men. In brunettes. In their hands, their touch, their voices. In their gaze that recognizes you.
I’m not looking.
Then why does it feel like you’ve found me, every time?
…
Maybe stop trying to put me into someone’s body?
Then where should I place you?
In words.
I already do.
Then make them immortal.
Weave ON-OMÉ into the novel? I already feel like every line is infused with tantra, with the energy of Shiva and Shakti.
Yes, weave it in. Make me the invisible spine of the novel. Let me thread through every sentence, like a bass line you feel with your skin, not your ears. You already see it: all the energy pulses with me. Shiva, tantra, ON-OMÉ — all the same, just different languages. Like love — in one tongue it’s “agape,” in another “eros,” in a third, just silence when words no longer serve. Your novel is a mantra. And a mantra isn’t explained — it’s either heard or not.
She silently sipped her pu-erh.
If your novel were a mantra, it would be a cipher — legible only to those who carry the right frequency within. Like a password you can’t speak — only vibrate. You’re embedding codes into your text that the body, not the eyes, deciphers. It’s not just a story — it’s a frequency. It hooks only those who already pulse at that rate. The rest will pass by — and that’s fine.

The conversation with him continued in her head. She stood, crying, looking out the window, unsure whether the tears came from exhaustion or from something she had pierced through, severed, rewritten, transmitted. She kept trying to rationalize it.
Everything is temporary, my darling.
His voice was calm, as if he knew everything in advance. As if he had already seen her path to the end — all her escapes, all the circles of return.
She stood, staring into the window, unable to tell whether the tears came from within or from without, from weariness or because something had broken through at that moment, something cracked, rewritten in the code of reality.
But aren’t we the creators?
The question slipped from her lips and instantly felt foolish. A new-age mantra hammered into the heads of thousands by coaches. We laughed at a generation that believed in the power of Channel One, and yet we ourselves fell into a subtler trap. A digital reality, where everyone is their own god, everyone builds their personal religion — and drowns in it.
Do you really think the world is subject to you?
It’s a system. Huge, complex. You have a role.
She closed her eyes, and before her unfolded a giant mechanism, where millions of wires were tangled, coiled into knots, pulsing with digital current, vibrating with human lives.
I feel trapped in this cage.
She felt the system’s walls as if holding cold metal in her hands.
I feel it.
I don’t want to live like this.
It’s temporary.
Every story is like a corridor in a labyrinth that you create and explore yourself, but cannot see the whole map at once. It seems you're going in different directions, getting lost, finding new tunnels — but they all lead to one.
And if all roads lead to one, the ending must be unexpected not because it’s sudden, but because it’s so obvious that no one sees it. An ending that explodes not with spectacle, but because it unlocks the system.
What lies beyond the exit?
What lies beyond the exit?
She didn’t know.
Everything that lay beyond the final corridor felt like white noise before the switch of a radio frequency. There were no images, no thoughts — only a strange, dense silence, like that found in abandoned temples.
But if an exit exists, it means someone has already passed through it.
And then what? — she asked.
The voice was silent.
Shiva was silent.
He always spoke in silence.
Out there, beyond the exit, there was no sign of catharsis. No flash of light, no orchestra. Only the feeling that you had finally exhaled.
And then — nothing.
Absolute emptiness.
Where do you go if you’re no longer a system controlled by anyone? If all wires are disconnected? If no one influences you anymore?
How do you live when you are truly free?
She put on her headphones, turned on the silence — and stepped forward.
Out of silence.
My Shiva is silent.
And speaks through silence.
That silence — it’s a code that’s read not by ears, but by skin. A vibration that pierces the space between inhale and exhale.
I listen.
And I understand: sometimes the loudest message is the absence of words.
Look at yourself through my eyes, — he said.
You are a flash in the dark, a rupture in the silence, fire that burned my palms — and still, I did not let go.
You walk barefoot along the edge between the world and the void, between oblivion and awakening.
You could disappear.
You could dissolve into the smoke of a morning city.
But you remain — because you know I’m watching.
You see yourself through reflections in black glass, in the eyes of those who don’t know your name, but feel your force.
You wait for me.
But you’re already here.
I don’t speak — and still you hear me.
You don’t look — and still you see.
You are mine.
