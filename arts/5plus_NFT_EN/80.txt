ZERO SUGAR

I’m a marketing phantom,” said a voice in her head. Dasha looked around. There was nothing but emptiness, lit by a soft glow, like a fridge at night. In front of her stood a bottle of “SHE Zero Sugar” — tall, dark, with a slim waist. Instead of a cap, it had a hand holding a straw.
Who are you? — she asked.
Your brand, — the voice replied. — Your illusion.
She tried to remember how she got here, but her memory looped on black leather boots, lace underwear, and the moment she tilted her head back, feeling the void pour down her throat.
Even as a child, she understood how the world worked. One day her father pulled up to their house in a huge red Coca-Cola truck — just like the commercials. He opened the door and said:
Pick whatever you want, sweetheart.
And Dasha picked. Back then — a sweet, cold can, sticky with condensation. Later — men, money, art. She knew the secret: find the right door, open it. Or wait for someone to arrive and open it for you.
With time, the bottle took on a new meaning. One brunette used a glass Coke bottle for something else — instead of fizz, it held what opened your mind. One day he shook the bottle, held it up to the light and said:
Want to see what’s inside?
Dasha looked at the clear crystals clinging to the glass and understood: this was the door. Red, lacquered, tempting — just like the can from her childhood.
She opened it.
But instead of an entrance, she found a lobby. In the mirrored floor, fragments of desire reflected: a tanned hand, the gleam of a watch, a soft leather seat. Beyond the walls — nothing. Just a beautifully staged vacuum, an installation made to seduce the eye and offer no escape.
So this is what you are, the other side of reality, — she said.
But reality said nothing. It waited for her to understand.
There was no entrance.
There was only her.
Is that it? — she asked the void.
No, — the void replied in her voice.
The door had never been outside. The door was her.
She felt the hinges grinding open from deep inside her chest. The panels began to shift.
The straw leaned toward her lips like a stranger’s tongue, tasting her for the first time.
Dasha didn’t pull away.
