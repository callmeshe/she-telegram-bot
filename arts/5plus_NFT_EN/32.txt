The God’s Shoes

She was light. So light, in fact, she cast no shadow.
That didn’t mean she didn’t exist—only that her existence passed through a different plane. Parallel. Shifted a few microns from the one where everyone else moved. She could feel them. They couldn’t feel her.
Except him.
He always stood still, as if reality checked in with him before taking its next step. His shoes gleamed. His suit fit like memory. That was all she knew of him. It was enough.
One day, jazz filled a restaurant. She had never danced. But her feet moved on their own, pressing softly into his shoes as if he were a stage. She spun—balanced on the edge between being and not—until she felt it: he noticed.
A fine crack spread through the surface of reality.
Who are you? — he asked.
The one who’s always been here.
He nodded, as if remembering something vital.
In the next moment, she was gone.

Her Inner Monologue

If God wears shoes, it means He walks the earth. And if He walks the earth, then He knows what it’s like to stumble. If He wears shoes, He has a path. Where is He going?
This strange feeling—safety—is like an expensive perfume. You don’t notice it at first, then suddenly realize it wraps you completely, like a hand pressed to your spine.
I stand on His shoes. He’s my personal god. And He has impeccable taste.
He’s nearby. Even if I can’t see Him.
I know: if I slip, His shoes will catch me. If I’m tired—I’ll sit on one and smoke, legs swinging into the void. He won’t ask what I’m doing. He won’t judge. He’ll just be where I need Him.
Maybe this is what love really is?
Not the choking fear of loss, not exposed nerves—but this: a quiet, steady knowing that He exists. That He’ll always be near, hands in His pockets, with that slight smile on His lips.
And I’m sure of one thing: even if the world collapses, His shoes will remain clean.

P.S.All the men in her life eventually narrowed down to those shoes. Maybe it was the same man—unfolded into different versions of himself. Or maybe it was God, playing her, changing faces but always wearing the same pair of shoes.
