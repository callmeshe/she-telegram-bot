Hunger and Books

She reads greedily.
Swallows sentences, washes them down with wine, blends the flavors, testing which truth bites harder—
the one in the glass or the one between the pages.
Pelevin teaches her to see through the world, like through a geisha’s paper fan—
he promises that behind the phantoms, there is only void.
Seneca laughs at that, sifting the ashes of the Stoics between his fingers.
Bukowski drinks with her in silence, rasping that life is just a few good lines and a hopeless dawn.
And tantra... Tantra whispers in her ear that the body is sacred madness.
That the world can be drunk with lips, fingers, eyes.
That skin and books are the same—if you know how to read.
She stacks books on her lap like lovers.
Sometimes she leaves bookmarks, hoping to return to the place where she last broke.
Sometimes she rips pages out with her teeth—
because she doesn’t need the word,
she needs the taste.
Bushido reminds her: to be a warrior is to die every day.
Buddhism says: don’t get attached.
But how can she not—
when every book is like a man whispering secrets and desire into her night?
She finishes the chapter.
Turns the page.
Takes another sip.
And chooses the next one.
