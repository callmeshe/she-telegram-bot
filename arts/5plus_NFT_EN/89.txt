Who is SHE

(a novel about those who invest in feminine mystery)
He held her with both hands. Gently. Like a rare asset. The way one holds something that seems to belong to you — but only for a moment. She wore sunglasses, stockings, stilettos, and a newspaper with the headline: "Who is SHE." He stared, unable to explain the pull toward something that defies naming.
She wasn’t a model. She was manipulation, wrapped in independence. Released in a limited edition — one. You couldn’t hold her — only collect. But not as a body. As a myth.
Are you reading something? — he asked.
Myself, — she said. — I’m always reading myself. You can try too. Just don’t confuse it with the desire to own me.
His Rolex ticked steadily. In her gaze was something money couldn’t buy — not in Tiffany, not in Hermès, not even in NFTs. She wasn’t a “girl.” She was a fund with restricted access. And to enter — you didn’t pay. You calculated how much of you was real.
He wanted to ask:
— And what if I buy anyway?
But she was already standing. Smoothing the crease of her skirt. Leaving only a crumb of a reply on the plate: “You’ll know who I am when you stop trying to see who you want me to be.”
