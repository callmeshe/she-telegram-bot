Babel Protocol

He took out his wallet. Ordinary — black leather, smooth, no logos. Everything real no longer needs branding. It wasn’t just a gesture. It was an activation.
Inside were bills. But instead of presidents’ portraits — women’s eyes. Sometimes they blinked. Sometimes — cried. One had a lipstick smudge, another — a tiny black mark like Mona Lisa’s mole. These weren’t banknotes. These were lived emotions, digitized, cashed out, stacked by denomination.
Babel Protocol activated, — said the voice from his wristwatch.
From the wallet’s folds, between the bills, her legs peeked out — black tights, stilettos. He remembered that code: #45C-SH01 — a woman he ordered not for sex, but for the richness of internal experience. The most expensive service on the market. The rarest.
Do you have sufficient funds? — asked the interface.
He nodded.
But he thought: no.
Because a real woman can’t be bought. Even if she’s already stitched into your wallet and integrated into your subconscious. Even if her thighs smell like Pure XS and her voice — like your favorite bedtime story.
He ran his finger across the bill. It trembled. Her legs moved.
You’re going to spend me again? — she asked, peeking at him through the layers of currency.
I’m trying to save, — he said.
For whom?
He said nothing. Because he didn’t know. Because “meaning” had long become currency — and he was bankrupt.
She smiled.
And vanished.
Only a lipstick trace remained on the note.
And emptiness in the wallet, which smelled like memory.
Thank you for using Babel Protocol™
You have spent: 1 experience.
Remaining: 0.”
He pressed RESTART.
Because even a reset is better than feeling nothing at all.
