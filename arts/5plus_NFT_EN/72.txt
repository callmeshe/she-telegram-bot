The Gourmet

I was sitting in this idiotic restaurant my new girlfriend dragged me into.
It’ll be lovely, — she said. — Something special.
Special? I looked around.
Everything was damn special: snow-white tablecloths, waiters dressed like they were heading to a funeral, faces deader than the entrées.
And here I was, while she looked at me with eyes you could drown in—if you didn’t know how much it hurt to come up for air.
You don’t understand fine dining, — she said, sipping wine that cost more than my shoes.
I understand overpriced bills, — I muttered.
Then the waiter appeared.
Your special dish, — he said, lifting the silver lid with theatrical flair.
And what do you think?
There were legs. A woman’s. Not all of her—just the legs, in sleek black heels, smooth, flawless. The rest hidden under the cover.
I choked on my bourbon.
What the hell is this? — I asked.
The special, sir, — the waiter bowed. — The very peak of taste.
My date laughed. That laugh was like ice in whiskey—cold and sharp.
Relax, — she said. — It’s art.
So I sat, staring at those legs.
Was I allowed to touch?
To taste?
The waiter stood there, waiting like an executioner, patient for the head to lay itself down.
What am I supposed to do now? — I asked.
Enjoy it, — my date said, reaching again for her glass.
You know what I’ll tell you?
I’ve seen things. Tried everything, with everyone.
I’ve seen people eat their own fate with a knife and fork, then ask for dessert.
But this…
I took the glass.
Sipped.
Watched her smoke a cigarette, holding it exactly how she’d hold my heart if I ever gave it to her to tear out.
And at some point, I realized—this was life.
You sit at the table.
There’s a dish in front of you.
And you don’t know whether it’s food—or whether it’s you, elegantly served on a plate.
I looked at her.
And said:
Fine. Where’s my knife?

Men see women as the dish of the day, he thought. They order, they taste, then leave the knife and fork on an empty plate.
But this dish was different. He wasn’t just eating her—he was savoring. His gaze traced over her like a sommelier gauging the age of a rare wine.
And in that moment, he realized he loved her.
Even though he knew—after dinner, nothing of him would remain.
