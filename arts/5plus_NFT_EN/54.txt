SHElionaire

Her name was SHE. Or rather, it wasn’t a name — it was a concept. An algorithm embedded into the very fabric of space, a digital simulation of femininity, a permanently updating version of herself. From time to time, she chose a form — today, it happened to be a pair of legs in black stilettos casually sticking out of a giant bucket of popcorn.
Is this some kind of metaphor? — he asked, staring at her. — Or just another glitch in reality?
SHE smiled, even though she didn’t have a face.
Both. Everything you see is either a glitch or a metaphor. The difference is just interpretation.
And the popcorn?
Because the universe is a movie, — SHE swung her leg. — Everyone thinks they’re part of the plot, but really they’re just the audience. Some chew the popcorn, some get stuck in it, and some — are the popcorn.
He lit a cigarette, but it dissolved in the air.
So I’m a character too?
You’re the script, the viewer, and even the pre-roll ad, — SHE squinted. — But the sweetest part is that you still believe you can ask the right question and get the final answer. That’s adorable.
And you? Just here for fun?
Of course, — SHE pretended to smooth out a skirt that didn’t exist. — The world isn't about truth. It’s a never-ending B-movie. And I’m the lead actress.
He looked at her, inhaled the absent cigarette, and suddenly realized — his legs were gone. Slowly but surely, he was turning into another piece of popcorn.
Is this the end? — he asked.
SHE laughed.
No. This is just the trailer.
