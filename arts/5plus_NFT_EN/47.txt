Focus on the Void

She had delicate wrists and a talent for disappearing.
Yesterday she didn’t exist, today she was standing in front of me, leaning against an old Canon as if the camera were an extension of her spine.
Watch, — she said, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. — I’m going to remember you now.
I watched her fingers press the shutter. The lens froze for a fraction of a second, pulling me inside.
Then I looked her in the eyes. Really looked.
And time stopped.
In her gaze I caught a flicker of boredom—
That kind of boredom found in people who know too much but can’t find anyone to share it with.
A sense of estrangement, like someone who once realized this world wasn’t theirs.
Inside her — a whole cosmos. But no one ever gave her a map.
That look could stop time.
It made you forget who you were
And believe, for a moment, that you mattered.
How do you choose what to photograph? — I asked.
— By the amount of emptiness, — she replied. — The more there is, the more interesting it gets.
I thought I understood her.
She lived in a world where people uploaded themselves into phone galleries,
Where strangers’ likes replaced warmth,
And lenses were trusted more than mirrors.
She would snap a shot,
And then, probably, check the lighting on her face.
Does anyone photograph you?
She smiled.
I don’t leave evidence.
And disappeared.
The next day, I scrolled through my feed
And stumbled upon a photo of her.
Black-and-white.
A girl in ruffles, slender fingers wrapped around a camera.
There was emptiness in her eyes.
But if you looked long enough—
You’d see something else.
She looked at the world as if it were just a background.
And you—
You were the only frame worth saving.
In some strange way, she created me anew.
