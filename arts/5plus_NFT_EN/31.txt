The World Is Big, and I Am Small

She had a personal god.
He wore expensive shoes, a perfectly tailored suit, and never looked down.
She lived somewhere in the folds of his trousers, in the shadows of his steps. When he moved through the city, she followed—light, almost invisible.
He didn’t know her name. But she knew his.
She knew how he drank his coffee—black, no sugar.
How he adjusted his cufflinks before a big meeting.
How he paused for just one breath before stepping out of the elevator, as if collecting himself.
She didn’t pray to him, but each of his footsteps was a revelation.
Sometimes, she felt he sensed her—when he slowed down in a crowd, or turned suddenly toward an empty space.
But he never truly saw her.
One evening, he walked into a jazz bar. The air was soft like old vinyl, and the piano spilled notes through the room as if uncertain where they should land.
And suddenly, something shifted inside her—
like the final pop of cheap prosecco in her stomach—
the realization that he existed. That he was simply standing there, filtering reality through music and whiskey, and the world around him just accepted it.
She couldn’t help herself.
She stepped out from her hiding place and climbed onto his shoe, arms wide, her movements light and dancing. The music swirled around her, and she spun—tiny, unnoticed, but free.
Her steps were so light he felt them not with his body, but somewhere deeper. A subtle vibration.
He looked down.
Who’s there? — he asked, brow furrowing.
She froze.
Held her breath.
He wasn’t supposed to hear her.
He wasn’t supposed to know.
He blinked. But she was gone.
Only the faintest breeze brushed his cheek—
or maybe it was the shadow of some unfamiliar feminine presence, already dissolving into the night before he could comprehend it.
Far away, in another city, a woman awoke in the middle of the night and looked at her palms.
On her skin was the faintest trace—
as if someone had just held her hand.
