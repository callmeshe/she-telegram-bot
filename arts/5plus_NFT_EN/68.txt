Margarita

– Miss, your cocktail.
She looked at the glass as if her own fate were floating inside it, stirred with cheap tequila and conscious mistakes.
A thin film of sticky past drifted on the surface. Ice cubes sank slowly into the cocktail — the remnants of his confidence, shattered by her indifference.
She ran her tongue along the rim of the glass, licking off the salt — the taste of broken promises and male ego crushed under her heels. She took a sip. Expected fire, tasted emptiness.
Anything else? – asked the bartender.
She smiled.
Yes. A new storyline.
