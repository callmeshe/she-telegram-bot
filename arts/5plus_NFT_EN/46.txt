Where the Text Ends and She Begins

She was sitting on a book, legs crossed, smoking an invisible cigarette.
You’re looking at me like I’m about to dance in your coffee cup, — she said, running a finger along her dress dotted with white circles that looked like Jupiter’s moons.
No, I’m just thinking... whether to drink you or read you, — I said, sipping my espresso.
I watched.
The way you look at a woman who, in a single second, undresses not her body — but an entire universe.
Not desire — recognition.
I knew women.
Knew how they played.
How they avoided saying what they meant.
How a flutter of lashes meant more than words, how they made silence their voice, how they hid inside smiles and widened their eyes to seem deeper.
How they killed men with a polite “well, okay.”
But she was different.
There was none of that curated mystery women wrap themselves in when they don’t know who they are.
She wasn’t a mystery.
She just was.
She’s the answer that doesn’t need a question.
Everything stopped.
No drama. No set design.
Just a point — where time spilled like sand.
That moment. The one people chase through bars, beds, and borrowed minds.
When reality dissolves.
When the past and future lose meaning — because in the present sits a woman on a book, and you realize: you must not move.
Not because you’ll lose her.
But because nothing else matters anymore.
I looked at her.
To drink you or to read?
He chose to read.
