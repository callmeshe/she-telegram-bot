Please, Just Not Tiffany

He held the ring like a safety deposit box. It gleamed the way it was supposed to — the right cut diamond, in the right little box, from the right boutique.
She looked at him and said calmly, without drama:
Please… just not Tiffany.
He said nothing. Because he knew — this wasn’t a whim. It was a code.
In those words there was: I am not a display. I am a cult. I don’t sparkle. I burn. I don’t want what everyone has. I want what’s ours.
When she removed her gloves, her fingers revealed rings — black, heavy, shaped like talismans. Gypsy. Shamanic. As if each had been bartered for with her own pain.
He understood: they weren’t accessories. They were protection.
I’m not against gold, — she said.
I’m against obeying the taste of the masses. I don’t collect status. I collect meaning.
So you want a different ring?
No.
I want a different man.
And he understood.
The only thing you can give a woman like that — is yourself.
Without the box.
Without the ribbon.
Without the illusion that you can earn her with a stone.
