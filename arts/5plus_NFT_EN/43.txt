Double Espresso for the Universe

She came to on the lid of a cardboard coffee cup. Judging by the logo, it was corporate brew — weak stuff, a watered-down latte for people afraid of their own lives.
She tried to stand, but the rubber lid gave slightly under her feet. Below her yawned a void, where a hand in a business suit confidently held a second cup — identical to hers.
You’re late for your shift, a voice said from above.
She looked up. Standing right in front of her was… herself. Only in a different suit. More expensive.
What the hell? she muttered.
This is capitalism, baby, the other her replied, coolly adjusting her hair. They cloned you so they wouldn’t have to pay two salaries. You’re a backup cup of coffee now.
What?!
Her copy sighed.
Relax. You’re in the “But First, Coffee™” system. It’s a corporate limbo. For those who lived on caffeine and deadlines but never figured out why. Now you just… exist. Until someone drinks you.
And then what happens?
You dissolve. No big deal. You've been doing that your whole life anyway.
She looked down into the espresso swirling below. The world beneath was disappearing into a frothy whirlpool of crema.
And what if I refuse?
Her copy shrugged.
Sure, you can try to escape. But spoiler: the only way out is to be consumed.
She stepped back — and without another thought, jumped.
The fall lasted less than a second.
And then, in some office, someone opened the first pack of coffee for the day.
