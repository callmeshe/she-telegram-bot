Dom Pérignon and His Woman


With the right woman, every day’s a celebration, — he said, pouring her into the glass.
She bubbled to the surface, adjusted her glove, ran her tongue across red lips, and looked around. Everything was as it should be: white gloves, a sharp suit, a hand gripping the stem of the glass with effortless control.
I hope I’m brut today, not Prosecco?
He smirked.
Today, you’re vintage.
She nodded approvingly and rolled her shoulders back.
So, what’s the occasion?
A man chooses what to drink.
She pretended to ponder, but deep in her effervescent soul, she knew: the choice was already made.
You’re not drinking me, — she said, — you’re drinking the feeling I give you.
He took a sip, squinting slightly.
As always, you’re right.
She laughed, sending ripples through the champagne.
Then enjoy me. Before I lose my sparkle.
