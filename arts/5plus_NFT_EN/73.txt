Zen and the Art of Brewing Women

Part 1
Andrey first saw her at a café called "Happiness." She was drinking cappuccino and staring into the void as if she were searching for enlightenment in the milk foam. He sat down across from her, hoping their eyes would meet, like in those films where love is born in a single glance.
— Have you ever thought, — she said suddenly, without looking up from her cup, — that coffee is a tiny black hole we fall into every morning, and we just pretend we’re starting a new day?
Andrey blinked. It was too accurate.
— Then coffee is a portal, — he replied, lazily stirring the foam. — You step into it, and come out a different person in a different world.
— And the only difference is that you think you’ve woken up?
— Yeah. Like loading a saved version of yourself. Just with a different battery level.
She nodded, flipped her cup upside down, and watched the coffee stain spread across the table.
— So the real question is: who’s loading us?
"Ready," Andrey thought. He wanted to answer, but felt like the dialogue was unfolding without him, like it wasn’t even meant for him.
— Sometimes I think I’ve fallen so deep, — she continued, — that I can’t resurface into clean reality.
She looked up. Her pupils were deep and enormous. Andrey felt himself being pulled in.
— You know, — she turned to him, — if you stare long enough into coffee grounds, you can start to see signs. I know how to read them.
She took his cup, sipped, and paused. Then looked into it like a mirror.
— Do you see this? — she leaned closer to his cup and frowned. — Strange... I see many female silhouettes, many legs. They're flying around a static figure.
She squinted, tilting the cup as if trying to make out details.
— Looks like a swarm of mosquitoes around a streetlamp. Except the lamp hasn’t been lit in a long time.
Andrey leaned in and looked too. Deep in the dark circle, something really was there — a vortex of slender legs spinning around a still center. He thought for a moment, then realized.
— You…
But she was gone.
He looked up. The girl was vanishing — dissolving into the coffee's darkness. First her shoulders, then her arms, then her head. Only her legs remained, sticking out of the grounds like a spoon left in the cup.
Andrey took a sip. The taste was bitter.
Part 2
A week later, they were at his apartment. She was flipping through a book of avant-garde paintings in the style of Malevich.
He brewed her like a good pu-erh.
Everything followed the ritual: first, scald the teaware to warm it. Then gently lay in the leaves — don’t crush or tear. The first rinse is discarded — dust, scum, the shell. Then you wait for the flavor to unfold.
She arrived in the evening when he'd already given up on expecting anything. Sat down like she’d always belonged there, scanned the space, chose the most comfortable position. He watched her like tea leaves in a glass gaiwan.
The first impression — too intense in color, might turn bitter.
The second — a tart depth that didn’t rush to reveal itself.
— I see you’re deep into the art of tea brewing, — she said.
He placed the kettle on, quietly watching the tiny bubbles rise. Still far from boiling.
— It’s a whole ritual, — Andrey replied. — Warm, pour, wait. Do you have patience?
She shrugged. Patience is when you get blocked on messenger and don’t create a new account just to say “hi.” Patience is waiting for the right price on a memecoin.
Andrey knew — when you brew a woman, you never know how many pours she can take.
She discarded the first brew herself, turning to the window.
The second — she inhaled deeply with a slight squint.
By the third, she began to open up.
He took a sip. The tea was too strong.
— Are you brewing me? — she asked suddenly, eyes still on the book.
Andrey shrugged.
— Isn’t that the whole point?
She smirked and set the cup aside.
— Just don’t over-steep it, — she said, — or it’ll turn bitter.
