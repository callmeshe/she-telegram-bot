The Letter That Never Was

He had read all her stories.
No — he had absorbed them. Let them bleed through him.
There was no analysis. No logic. Just a state.
Her words hummed on a strange frequency — the kind that pulses behind your temples like a third espresso in a row.
The titles seemed pretentious. But the insides? Sticky. Alive.
As if each text was not written for everyone,
but addressed — directly — to him.
Each story felt like a glitch.
Or maybe — a real rhythm that had been muted until now.
He saw himself in these glitches.
The quickened pulse wasn’t from beauty.
It came from recognition.
Not “how beautiful,” but “fuck, that’s me.”
The stories didn’t explain.
They didn’t need to.
They simply were.
They didn’t invite — they summoned.
And at some point, he couldn’t take it anymore.
Not from pain. From precision.
From the rawness of a literature that didn’t ask —
but drilled straight through.
So he sat down.
And wrote her a letter.
You don’t write.
You open doorways.
Not to the world — to sensation.
Each of your stories feels like reality taking one small step back to let in something we’re usually too afraid to touch.
These aren’t texts. They’re frequencies encoded in letters. And if someone manages to decode them — they might vanish.
Or become who they truly are.
I don’t know who you are. But I know this: after you, nothing feels the same.
You’re not literature.
You’re the glitch.
And I’m grateful to have been inside it.
I’d love to meet you. But I know — it’s impossible.
You yourself don’t know who you’ll be tomorrow.
Still — thank you.
He folded the letter.
Found an envelope.
Wrote her name with an ink pen.
Sealed it with a wax monogram.
Ceremonial. Almost theatrical.
He didn’t seal it shut.
Didn’t search for an address.
Just left it on the table.
He knew — she’d feel it.
The next day, her new story appeared.
The first line read:
You’re not literature. You’re the glitch.
He wasn’t surprised.
He was inside that glitch.
And he liked it there.
He smiled.
Maybe the letter never existed.
But it got to her.
