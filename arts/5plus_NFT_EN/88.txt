A Woman as a Morning Ritual

He ordered a double espresso. The barista handed him a cup. Inside — a pair of women's legs. In black stockings. And a cigarette. Burning. As if someone had just taken a drag — and vanished. He wasn’t surprised. In this city, he hadn’t been drinking coffee for a long time. He drank meanings, steeped in hormonal hunger. He drank scenes, laced with soft eroticism and the flavor of loneliness. He drank illusions that one could keep a woman without drinking her to the end.

Sugar? — the waitress asked.

Only if she agrees, — he replied.

The waitress nodded. She placed a note on the table: “She agrees. But only to deep silence. And no shaking the table. She’s sensitive.”

He stared into the cup. Her legs were crossed — as if waiting for a kiss. The cigarette trembled slightly. The whole scene was absurdly intimate. As if he had caught someone’s soul smoking after.

He leaned in. Whispered into the steam:

Sorry, I don’t drink women. I slowly brew them. And only if they don’t mind being tea.

At the bottom, a phrase written in lipstick remained: “I’m not for a sip. I’m for a drag.”
