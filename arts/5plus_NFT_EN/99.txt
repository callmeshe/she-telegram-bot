The Ceremony of Pu’er Reality

He didn’t eat women. He steeped them.
Every morning, by strict ritual: chaban, chahai, gaiwan, SHE.
He poured 98°C water over her and waited for her to unfold.
She sat in lotus on a teacup stand, as if born in a porcelain bowl.
Her spine — straight. Her silence — hot.
She said nothing. Only absorbed.
And gave back — in flavor.
Who are you? — he asked.
But tea doesn’t answer. It only opens.
He drank her in infusions. At first — bitter. Then — softer.
In the fourth steep, she told him how others had once brewed her.
In the seventh — she said nothing, but he heard a voice.
In the eighth — she disappeared.
A trace remained on the saucer.
Like after a woman leaving at night:
no goodbye,
but the scent left on the neck,
the taste on the lips,
and the burn on the tongue.
He lifted the bowl to his eyes.
At the bottom — sediment.
A symbol.
A word.
A character.

(Emptiness.)
He understood: all this time, he hadn’t been drinking her.
He was drinking himself.
Filtered through her.
And it was the best tea of his life.
