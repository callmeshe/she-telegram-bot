Mutual Deformation

Her name was SHE.
Not because it was a name, but because it was a state of being. He held her by the left thought. Another — by the right weakness. He wasn’t a man. He was the market. Or memory. Or two pasts in a single present.
She was fabric.
Woven from the voices of ex-lovers, the scent of cigarette mornings, the rustle of disappointments.
He — made of deals.
Or rather, the ones that never happened.
He pulled.
And the other — pulled too.
They both wanted her.
Not her, exactly. But what they could prove through her.
She smiled.
A smile made of anti-memory. From that point where a woman no longer resists — but hasn’t yet surrendered.
Which one of you will protect me, instead of pulling? — she asked.
— We're not the protecting type, — they replied in unison.
— Then stay with the remnants. I’ll go.
She didn’t slip from their hands —
she slipped from the script.
Like silk from a dusty closet.
Like an error from the system.
Like something real from a world where everyone just wants to hold.
And when both opened their palms —
there was only fabric.
No name. No body. No SHE.
Only a trace.
On their fingers.
And in their lives.
