Cream

He brought the cup closer. Usually, it held nothing but coffee. Sometimes—with cinnamon. Once—with a rose traced in the foam, which felt suspicious. But this time—it was her.
Silent. Folded like a Japanese fan after the dance. Too real to be a fantasy. Too fantastical to be real. Instinctively, he glanced at his Rolex—time wasn’t moving. The world had frozen, as if the hands were counting not seconds, but the distance to the moment when everything would slip out of control.
He didn’t ask how she ended up there. He simply knew: this wasn’t about coffee. It was about the someone inside him too, trembling in wait for a touch.
He reached for the cream. And began to pour—slowly. As if he were not adding milk, but permission.
And suddenly he felt—he was not the one drinking. He was the one being poured into.
— You think I’m coffee? — No. You’re everything that comes after. — Then be careful. — Why? — Because I’m not made of sugar. There’s chili in dark chocolate, splashes of Tabasco, a drop of pomegranate reduction, and cream—the kind that can only be poured with reverence. Too hot—I’ll curdle. Too fast—I’ll vanish.
He poured. Slowly. As if it were a vow, not an ingredient.
— Aren’t you afraid I’ll dissolve? — I am. — Then why risk it? — Because I don’t want to drink. I want to taste you.
