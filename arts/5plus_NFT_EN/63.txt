In God's Hands

That night, she fell asleep in a hammock held by God. Not a specific God — just someone's hand in a black blazer, gripping both ends of the rope.
She didn’t know who he was. Maybe one of those men you meet in airports between connections, on the exhale after a deal, in a chair at the bar where the bartender already knows his drink. With a straight part in his hair, hands that know the worth of a woman’s body and the weight of a glass. A wrist bruised by upside-down Rolex. A walk that smells like decisions.
Gods rarely take the metro. More often — Porsche 911: sharp as the formula of desire. Or a Mercedes AMG — not daddy’s, but the low one, sexy as a whisper in an elevator. Sometimes — a Bentley. Not to impress. Just to be.
Sometimes you find them near cigar shelves, at vinyl parties in the silence between tracks, or in a stranger you barely noticed, but remember for years.
Maybe he was just an illusion.
When she woke up, the night was warm. The hammock swayed. And the hand still held her — just as firmly.
"Can you let me go?" — she asked.
"Do you want to fall?" — God replied.
She paused. Falling would make sense. Everything suspended eventually falls.
"No," — she said.
"Then sleep."
She closed her eyes. And God kept holding her.
