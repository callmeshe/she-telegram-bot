Old Money. Old Love

She stared at the glowing windows of old apartment buildings, wondering how many lives lived inside them. How many glasses of sparkling wine were raised for new deals, how many people fell asleep clutching cold iPhones, how many didn’t fall asleep at all.
— An apartment in the center, — she said aloud, testing the words on her tongue. — A button phone. Real time.
In her head, it sounded like the perfect escape plan. To have a space that wouldn’t steal her freedom, but give it back. To stop measuring her worth by reach, her life by statistics. To live as if she’d been born into a family where art existed outside the laws of the market, and money came simply because the world willed it.
She imagined the algorithms, networks, publishers, and art resellers working for her. Her paintings selling, her texts being quoted, her name floating in the right circles — without her participation. She simply lived. No notifications, no unread messages, no endless need to prove her significance.
The button phone lay in front of her like a ticket to another dimension.
In the world of old money, no one proves they exist.
They just do.
And so did she.
She was tired of the noise. The constant digital migraine where every emotion was digitized, packed into a story, and put up for sale. Tired of men who saw her as an avatar, but never as a person. Tired of the race for attention, likes, and trends, where the only thing at stake was always the same — her time.
One day she turned off her phone and realized the world didn’t collapse. No one died from not getting her reply in five minutes. No one even noticed she wasn’t in their feed. And for the first time in a long time, she felt alive.
She bought an old apartment in the center of St. Petersburg — high ceilings, heavy curtains, plaster molding, and creaky wooden floors. She got herself a button phone that could only make calls and started living as if it were 1998 again. No notifications, no pressure to be online 24/7. The world could wait.
She wrote books but didn’t chase publication. If the world needed them — it would find them.
She painted, but didn’t post. If her art was meant for someone — it would reach them.
The world is an organic system; it knows what truly matters.
And then she met him.
A quiet, impenetrable love, free from outsiders. A love that didn’t need to be staged for social media, didn’t need to monetize emotions or seek validation in comments.
They just were. Together.
In this city, in this apartment, in this time that belonged only to them.
And it turned out — that was enough.
She woke up in a place that wasn’t her apartment. Or rather — it was, but different: ceilings stretching into the sky, antique parquet, windows reflecting the gray St. Petersburg light.
On the nightstand — a button phone. Not hers, but somehow familiar.
Yesterday, she’d still been scrolling, watching people try to sell their love for likes, their feelings for stats, and themselves for algorithms.
But something had happened — a dream, a system glitch, or maybe the universe had just decided to reboot her life.
Now everything was different.
No stories.
No notifications.
The world existed on its own, and she no longer had to prove she existed within it.
Things found her when needed: books wrote themselves, paintings emerged, thoughts reached the minds they were meant for.
She simply lived.
Like old money.
Calmly.
Without strain.
Without fear of being late.
He didn’t message her.
He just appeared.
Sometimes with coffee.
Sometimes with a movie ticket.
Sometimes with a scent or a piece of jewelry — the only thing he wanted her to wear when they were together.
Sometimes he said nothing.
In that silence, there was no emptiness — only essence.
A quiet, impenetrable love, where nothing needed explaining.
Everything was felt.
Everything was known.
She gave herself a vow not to display any of it.
She married their intimacy.
She allowed herself the luxury of loving only him, without shouting it, without sharing, without performing.
In a world built for other people’s eyes — she chose to live for her own.
And in that choice — was magic.
She knew that every moment with him was the most precious of her life. She sank into the present like he sank into her.
No room for strangers.
Everything they shared — was theirs alone.
All the photos and videos stayed just for them — a chronicle of their nights, jazz-filled baths, Paris walks, breakfasts, and dinners.
They turned off the outside world.
And lost nothing.
On the contrary — everything became sharper, more meaningful.
There was no place for the digital world in their love — the one that seeps like a virus into every corner.
That world was foreign to them.
This was love without outsiders.
Without spectacle.
Without the urge to sell it in a glossy wrapper.
Because they’d hit the ultimate jackpot — finding each other.
They simply remembered how love should look —
And what it needed to be protected from to survive.
P.S. Someone from her old life, from the days when she hadn’t yet dared to fully trust her heart or intuition, sat staring at the city skyline. He picked up the phone and dialed her number — only to hear: "Sorry, the subscriber is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later." But the truth was — that subscriber was already unavailable forever.
