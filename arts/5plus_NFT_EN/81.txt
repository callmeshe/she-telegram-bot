Black Pearl. Mother-of-Pearl

She woke up inside a shell.
Outside, it was dark. The damp folds had closed, leaving only a thin slit where a sliver of light barely slipped through. The air smelled of salt and something ancient. She ran her palm along the inner surface — smooth, cold, mother-of-pearl.
On her thigh lay a string of black pearls.
It took her a moment to remember how she got there. The night before, he had gifted her a necklace and said:
— Put it on. I want you to become my pearl.
She wore it.
Then came the champagne glint in his eyes, promises dissolved in a glass, his hand at the back of her neck.
And now — she was here.
Dasha tried to pry the shell open, but it wouldn’t budge.
— Who am I? — she asked the void.
— You are what is treasured, — the void replied in her own voice.
She looked at the beads. Slick, cold, black — like the eyes of the one who placed her here.
She clenched the pearl in her hand. Her nails dug into the smooth surface, and suddenly she understood: mother-of-pearl is calcium and pain. It’s a soft body trying to protect itself.
She gripped the strand tighter.
And the shell began to open.
