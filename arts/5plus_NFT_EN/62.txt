MOSKVICHKA

She came to in what felt like a bathtub of Dom Pérignon, with the faint echo of a Cartier commercial playing somewhere in the background.
Tried to move — couldn’t.
Her body was pinned in by glass walls, the air thick with the scent of expensive ambition.
What the hell? — she thought, just as something shifted and the world tilted.
He was sitting in front of her.
Of course in a perfectly tailored jacket.
Of course in the haze of something luxurious, something not sold at your average boutique.
He held the glass by the stem like a crypto wallet — confident, proprietary — and looked at her with a smirk, as if he’d just invested in her through an app.
Is this a joke? — she asked, eyeing her reflection.
Hair slicked back, black blazer, sheer stockings, lips as cold as the ice in White Rabbit cocktails.
You’re in my drink, — he said.
What kind of drink?
Moskvichka.
She glanced at the table: a napkin with her lipstick print, a string of pearls, two black cherries — like a metaphor for the "moral values" of Rublevka's regulars.
Just like real life — only no chance of turning a profit.
Is this a metaphor? — she asked.
This is reality, — he said. — I ordered a cocktail. Isn’t that what you always wanted? To be chosen by someone worthy?
She froze.
You think I’m just another Insta-diva on some Patriki balance sheet?
I think you’re a cocktail, — he said, swirling the glass gently, her legs sliding along the curve.
Just the right ingredients. A dash of branding, a hint of tragic backstory, a whisper of mystery, well-aged. And not a grain of sugar.
And you’re the investor who sees the value?
No, — he smiled, setting the glass down. — I’m the one who won’t drink you.
The world tilted again.
Somewhere near the base of the glass, two black cherries sighed.
