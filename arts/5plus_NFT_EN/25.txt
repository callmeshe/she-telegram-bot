With Him, She Remembered She Could Fly

She used to live like a folded paper bird inside the drawer of a dresser. Light, but unable to fly. Men came and went, leaving creases on her skin—like invisible lines on delicate paper. They saw a beautiful origami figure. But none of them knew how to unfold her properly.
And then he appeared.
His hands moved with confidence, but gently. He didn’t pull. He didn’t force. He simply gave her a subtle nudge. And at some point, she felt air slip beneath her shoulder blades—spreading her wings.
It was almost imperceptible. As if some invisible force had widened the space around her.
They were sitting in a café, when he said:
Close your eyes.
She did.
What do you feel?
She wanted to say nothing, but suddenly realized something had stirred inside. Clean air. Weightlessness. Anticipation. Like the moment before stepping onto a rooftop—before leaping into the unknown.
She opened her eyes. He was looking at her like he knew everything that had come before. And for the first time in a long while, she felt light.
She stepped outside, and without thinking—took a step. The wind lifted her, her dress trembled, and she suddenly understood: with him, she remembered she could fly.
