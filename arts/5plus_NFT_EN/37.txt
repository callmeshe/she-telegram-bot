Error 404: SHE

She was stuck between two realities.
Between this anxious, flickering world where everything boiled down to numbers, and that emptiness no likes, no comments, not even male attention could fill—the kind that felt like stolen Wi-Fi: technically there, but useless.
Every morning started the same.
Open her eyes.
Open the screen.
Open herself to the metrics.
Zero new messages.
A couple of dumb emojis in response to something deep.
One comment that just said “sexy.”
A kind of mute digital darkness, where everything made noise except anything real.
Men were the same.
Overcharged egos, empty pockets.
They believed they had the right to her just because they watched her Stories.
And in a way—they did. Social media had long since turned her into a freemium app.
The algorithm demanded movement.
If you don’t move—you’re invisible.
And if you’re invisible—you’re dead.
She posted Stories.
Strung new meanings.
Edited thoughts to make them easier to swallow.
She looked for her people.
But more and more often, "your people" felt like just slightly more polite strangers.
Then, one morning, she didn’t turn on her phone.
At first, the withdrawal kicked in.
The world she lived in needed confirmation of existence:
Where are you?
What are you doing?
Who are you today?
She said nothing.
By evening, it felt like she didn’t exist.
And then came the silence.
It sounded like a server shut down—not that it made noise, but its absence burned in her ears.
The system tried to reload.
Nothing happened.
No likes.
No views.
No algorithm to tell her what to do next.
Then reality updated.
There were no stats.
No men who felt entitled to her.
No sticky emoji-comments.
Just air.
Just the street.
Just her own movement—forward.
And that’s when she understood:
This is what enlightenment feels like.
Not going viral.
Not chasing millions of impressions.
Just being.
