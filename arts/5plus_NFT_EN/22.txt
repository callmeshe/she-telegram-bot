Pocket

When she appeared in his life, he didn’t quite know what to make of it.
She was small—small enough to fit in a pocket—
yet somehow, she felt enormous.

Do you carry me because you want to?
Or because you don’t know where else to put me? —
she asked one day, swaying gently on the edge of his pinstriped blazer.

He looked at her.
She had smooth skin, sharp collarbones, and a scent that mixed woody sandalwood, the dry bitterness of tobacco, and the faint trace of tar soap.
She liked fragrances that lingered for hours,
the kind you remember forever.
It’s just easier this way, — he said.
They didn’t talk much.
He simply felt her warmth near his wrist
when sitting in a bar, drinking whiskey,
or riding in a taxi toward his empty apartment.
Sometimes, she moved in her sleep—
then he would gently adjust her,
like an inner pocket accidentally turned inside out.
You know I’ll fall out someday, right? — she said once.
I know.
One day, she did.
When he noticed she was gone,
he stood still in the alley for a long time,
staring at the dark asphalt.
Then he pulled out a cigarette, lit it, and took a drag.

Everything seemed to still be in place.
Only now—
his pocket was empty.
