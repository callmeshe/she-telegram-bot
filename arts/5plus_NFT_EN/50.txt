The Session

She stepped into the room and knew instantly — yes, it was him.
A vintage leather armchair, a massive oak desk, books — worn, but alive — survivors of many thoughtful conversations.
Outside the window, just as it should be, stood his Porsche.
Black. 911. No ridiculous add-ons. Just perfection.
Do you drink coffee? — he asked, not looking up from his notebook.
Only the good kind.
Then we’ll have to order.
She sat down.
What’s going on with you? — he asked, glancing at his gold cufflinks.
I’m annoyed.
By what?
Men who walk up to a Porsche holding keys to a Lada.
Or women who've mastered the "meaningful face," put on a mask of depth,
but inside — just a hollow plastic container.
The game of perfection.
It’s a waste of even a second.
You talk like you're living in a film where everyone has to play their parts.
Aren’t we?
He smiled.
And in what genre do you see yourself?
She paused for a moment.
Noir. Where the city is a stomach digesting people,
and I just don’t want to be food.
You want to be the chooser, not the chosen?
I want to be the one who can’t not be chosen.
He nodded.
That’s a solid intention. We can work with that.
He stood, walked over to the coffee machine, pressed a few buttons.
Do you like games?
Only if the stakes are real.
What if your desire is the stake?
She narrowed her eyes.
Then I always win.
He laughed.
You know, I like that you even see therapy as a transaction.
What’s wrong with that?
Nothing... as long as you know what you’re selling.
He placed a cup of coffee in front of her, sat across, fingers interlaced.
So. Shall we begin?
