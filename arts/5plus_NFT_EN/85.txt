Viva al Dente

a novel about a woman you want to eat, buy, and worship
She was sitting on a plate. No metaphors. Just sitting there — black stilettos, sheer stockings with no underwear, a lace corset not supporting her breasts, but the inner architecture of power over hunger.
The pose — like after sex with someone you’ll never forget. The gaze — like after a glass of wine that wasn’t on the menu. A golden fork stuck out of her back. On it — a city, tattooed across her skin. Every street — a memory of those who once tasted her, but couldn’t handle it.
She didn’t sell art — she served it, like oysters: on ice, with lemon, in a setting where no one dared ask the price.
Each piece — not an illustration. But a sensation.
The kind you’ll post later with the caption: “Don’t ask who she is. I’m still starving.”
When her NFTs dropped, collectors felt it.
They needed her. On the screen. In the mind. On the wall.
She never said “buy me.” She just looked.
And that was enough to awaken the mouth, the wallet, the sinner.
One collector — a wealthy, sexually heightened philosopher from Berlin — left a review:
"I held her on the cold screen of my iPad and knew I’d never feel anything hotter. Not even if they delivered me a woman in red with a Patek Philippe tomorrow."
She lived inside her art.
Each time she was opened, she came to life like perfect pasta — hot, tender, with a hint of salt on her neck.
And when another man wrote:
“I want to eat you. No blockchain poetry.”
She answered:
“Add me to your cart. I don’t argue with appetite.”
P.S.
Each drawing in her collection now felt like a flavor-orgasm.
Not just NFT — a gastrosexual ritual.
Those who collected her stayed silent — like after dinner at Le Cinq.
