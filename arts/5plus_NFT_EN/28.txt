Remember Who You Are, Through Her

He unfolded the newspaper and found a woman lying on the front page. Not a photo, not an illustration—real. With silky hair, eyes half-lidded, wearing a dress whose folds flowed like liquor spilled into the morning.
Are you news or coffee? — he asked.
She shrugged, and the pages of the paper trembled.   
I’m what you read first thing in the morning.
He took a sip of espresso and felt the coffee pulling him into the cup, and the woman—into herself. As if both realities had conspired to drag him into a game without rules.
You don’t believe me? — she asked, her gaze grazing his face like the slanted rays of autumn sun.   
Me? — he raised an eyebrow. 
I believe everything I see. But you’re not real. That’s impossible. You’re just a newspaper. Print. She laughed. A soft sound, like the rustle of pages.   
We’re all just material until we come alive in someone’s mind. You exist here too, — she touched the page with her finger, — and not only on these sheets.
He felt his body respond to her touch, as though something in his world had dissolved into air. The print softened. The text began to blur.
What do you want from me? — he asked again, meeting her eyes, now flickering with the light of the waking city. She smiled. Cold, but sincere.   
I’m here to remind you that you keep looking for meaning in material. But everything artificially made is meaningless—until you decide to give it meaning. You’re trying to be real. But in truth, you’re paper too. Paper that fell into a cup.
He froze, trying to process her words, but all he felt was lightness—like his consciousness had scattered into atoms. His thoughts melted into her voice.
Then who am I? — he whispered.   
You’re the one who reads me, — she said it in a way that made him certain she wasn’t joking. She was a part of him.
She tilted her head slightly, her fingers gently touching the edge of the paper.   
What are you searching for in this newspaper? What lies beyond this page? What are you trying to find in the world you made up for yourself? You don’t believe in reality. You want it to believe in you.
He closed his eyes, feeling the world around him grow more transparent. Sensations faded.
It doesn’t matter, — he said. 
I was only looking for confirmation that this isn’t just a game.   
It’s always a game, — she whispered. 
The question is who’s playing it, and why.
And you? — he asked, caught between disappointment and relief.   
Me? I’m what you need to stop searching for it. I’m only the illusion of your mind. You can feel me—but never catch me. Thoughts are always just moments. And they always pass.
Her words dissolved, and he felt the paper tighten again in his hand. His eyes returned to the silhouette of the woman still lying on the page. She hadn’t vanished. She had become real.
And that mattered more than anything.
He set the coffee cup down, and in that moment he understood —  the reality he’d been so desperately searching for had always been  right beside him.
