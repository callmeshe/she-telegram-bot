A SHORT NOVEL

Do you know, mister, that coffee and time share the same nature? — she asked, running her fingernail across the lid of the cup, leaving a thin trail of blood.
The mister — owner of one and a half Chinese funds and a car dealership in Barvikha — looked at her over the haze of his cigar.
And what would that be?
You can’t stop either. But you can distort them.
She flicked her hand, and something red fell into the cup.
Maybe it was a drop of her nail polish.
Maybe something else.
Drink, mister. Time is running out.
He looked at her dress — something that seemed to have stepped out of a black-and-white film.
At the clock printed on the cardboard sleeve of the cup.
And what happens if I drink?
You’ll end up where you’re supposed to be.
The mister took a sip.
In the same instant, stock markets crashed, his accounts were wiped clean,
and he found himself in a small teahouse in Kyoto,
where an old man in a kimono was silently pouring him matcha.
She, of course, was already gone.
