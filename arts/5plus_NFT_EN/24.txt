Breakfast for the Chosen

When he woke up, she was already gone. On the bedside table lay a perfectly pressed shirt, a cup of still-warm coffee, and a newspaper with a bold headline splashed across the front page: WHO IS SHE?

He unfolded the paper. The column spoke of a woman who appeared at night in the city’s most expensive bars.
She drinks red dry wine, turning the glass in her fingers as if reading it like a book. Sometimes she actually does—tucks one leg beneath her, opens an old volume, then gets distracted by conversation, never marking the page. She smokes rarely, but when she does, it’s like she’s remembering something deeply personal. She looks at men as if she can categorize them faster than Tinder Gold’s neural net.”

No name. No age. No photo. Just a description:
She’s like the perfect amount of salt in a dish—when it’s missing, the world feels dull. When there’s too much—it stings. She speaks sharply, but sometimes tilts her head while listening, and in that moment, you want to hand her the keys to your apartment. No one knows where she comes from, or where she disappears at dawn. Some call her a mirage. Others—real magic.”

He lowered the paper. Next to the cup lay a torn piece of her fine stocking, like someone had left a bug in the system—a reminder that the night had, in fact, happened.

He smirked. Then put on the shirt, took a sip of the coffee—bitter, strong, no sugar—and went about his day. Just another morning in the simulation.
