Zero Sugar

He was a trader.
She was his crypto-muse. A lucky talisman.
He called her Zero Sugar. Said she was like diet cola: a sweet illusion with nothing but pure caffeine behind it.
You're not real, — he whispered to her, exhaling smoke into the screen.
Neither are you, — she replied, kicking her legs in the air. — You're just numbers.
Her body stretched across the keyboard. The screen glowed with green candlesticks, playing a quiet techno-hymn of capitalism. She wore black latex and the transparent shadow of desire. She smelled like Marlboro Gold and his childhood fantasies. A cigarette smoldered between his fingers.
He crushed the energy drink can and stared at her. The glossy black latex on her legs reflected the laptop light. There was something infinitely right about it — being in the moment without the need to explain its meaning.
Do you want me? — she asked.
I want the price to go up.
Liar, — she smiled.
She laughed. So did he.
Then she put in her earbuds, turned on lo-fi with static, and they fell silent.
He heard the order book whispering:
"Close everything. Before it’s too late."
But he couldn’t. He never could.
Even in the red. Even through the pain.
He knew she’d disappear the moment he shut the laptop.
But tomorrow would bring a new day, new charts, new coffee, new Zero Sugar.
And that was enough for him.
