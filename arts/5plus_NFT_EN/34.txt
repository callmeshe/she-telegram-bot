Morning Monologue

She slowly uncurls her fingers, sensing that the world hasn’t quite solidified into its final shape. There’s still time to choose what to become: the girl inside the cup, or the cup itself; the liquid that takes any form, or the spoon that stirs it.
She extends her hand, watching how imaginary condensation settles on the long gloves — remnants of sleep evaporating like yesterday’s night, leaving only this half-warm Kafkaesque cocoon. Or a cappuccino.
I wonder, if I could choose what to be, — she murmurs, — would I choose myself?
Her body sinks softly into the cup’s darkness, like into meditation. Beyond the porcelain wall, someone is rushing to work, texting, falling in love, stealing, building financial pyramids. But inside her — stillness.
Outside the thin porcelain shell, someone bites into likes, trades their soul for reach, converts attention into money, money into emptiness, and emptiness into the intertwining of bodies. The world spins madly, distilling itself into metrics.
But inside her — stillness.
The spoon touches the rim again, and she knows: this world has already begun to stir.
