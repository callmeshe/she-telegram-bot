Espresso in the Void

The barista at “Renoir” didn’t ask questions. He knew: if a woman walked in at 3 a.m. wearing a little black dress and casting no shadow, the only proper response was to brew a double espresso and keep your mouth shut.
The usual? he asked, watching her pull a cigarette from her bag, light it, and vanish into a barely perceptible shimmer.
She nodded, slid a thin bracelet from her wrist, and left it on the counter. He knew — it wasn’t payment. It was a reminder.
There are only three things in this city that never fail, she said, glancing around the café with an absent gaze. The espresso machine, my endless legs, and the illusion that everything’s under control.
She picked up the cup, took a sip, and dissolved into the air — leaving behind a faint scent of patchouli and something else… something that smelled like longing for what never came to be.
The barista wiped the counter, took her bracelet, and hung it on the nail in the wall. There were others.
I wonder how many times you can come back to this world before coffee stops tasting so damn good, he muttered.
The machine whirred, as if in agreement.
He was alone again.
Or was he?
Another cup had appeared on the counter.
No one had placed it there.
He didn’t flinch. He just exhaled.
Because he knew — tomorrow would be another day.
Another morning.
And the door would open on its own.
P.S. This story is for the café that became my portal to beauty when everything around me felt ugly. Sometimes, one island like that is enough to survive in a city where you don’t even want to open your eyes.
