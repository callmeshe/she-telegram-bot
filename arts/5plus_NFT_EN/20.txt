SHE Shot

When I ordered my usual shot of reality at the bar called Emptiness, I had no idea the bartender would serve me something special this time.

What is this? — I asked, staring at the glass vessel where a woman in a black dress sat, gently swaying.
She was perfect. So perfect, she barely seemed to exist.

Our new cocktail, — said the bartender, whose face could just as well have been a face—or its absence. — It’s called SHE. Limited edition.

The woman, still posing, looked straight at me.
Or at whatever was left of me.

You want to drink me too? — she asked, in the voice of a perfume ad that promises love, eternity, and immortality in a single bottle.

I pretended to think.
Though, truthfully, I hadn’t thought in a while—algorithms had been doing that for me.

Who are you? — I asked anyway.

I’m the taste you’ll never forget—because I never existed.

The bartender smirked, as if he’d heard this dialogue a hundred times.
He probably had.

But if I drink you, — I said, — you’ll disappear.

She leaned toward me, resting her elbows on the rim of the glass.

Or maybe that’s when I’ll become you?

I picked up the glass.
The ice clinked like a world on pause.

And suddenly, I knew:
maybe I, too, am someone’s drink,
ordered at Emptiness,
just not yet consumed.

To the meeting that never happened, — I said.
And took a sip.

A strange taste lingered on my tongue—
he taste of a woman
who doesn’t exist.
