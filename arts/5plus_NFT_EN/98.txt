SHE Protocol™

He always loved lists.
To-do lists, shopping lists, women lists.
Especially the last ones. He didn’t keep them in his memory — he offloaded them immediately into a notebook. Montblanc pen. The ink was black, like his mornings after sleepless nights.
Who are you here? — she asked, unfolding across the page like someone had just drawn her.
I’m just writing, — he replied, eyes fixed on the curve of her spine.
She stayed silent. Like those comic book heroines who live between panels. Half-naked, but not for arousal — for attention. And it worked. His hand trembled with focus: one mistake on this page could rewrite his entire reality.
He wanted to list her.
She wanted to be the exception.
I’m not your list, — she said.
Then who are you?
I’m what you’ll never finish writing.
He knew it was true.
Some women don’t go in calendars.
They break out. Slip away.
Become ink-coded into the skin of the mind.
On the last line, he still wrote:
SHE — Not to be completed.”
The notebook warmed in his hand.
The system registered a new entry in memory.
A prompt appeared on the screen:
Entry logged. You have reached emotional limit.
Do you want to overwrite previous connections?”
He pressed:
No.”
Because women like this — you don’t rewrite.
You read them.
For the rest of your life.
Between the lines.
