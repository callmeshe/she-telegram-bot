The Irreversible High

He noticed her at the bar— long legs, black dress, the way she drank like the world had already ended yesterday.

Want to drink me? — she asked.

On the table between them stood a bottle labeled Drink Me.
He looked at her, then at the bottle.
There was no difference.

He took a sip.
Then another.
She smiled—the rare kind of smile a woman gives when she’s not trying to be liked.

She spoke of physics, metaphors, alcohol, and God,
but it all came down to one thing—
you just have to drink.

He drank her words.
Drank her gaze.
Drank her breath.
And with every minute,
she grew more transparent.

You know people fall into two types? — she said, throwing a leg over the edge of the glass. — The ones who leave. And the ones who get left.

He finished the bottle.

She vanished.

But the taste of her remained.
It lingered on his tongue,
in his blood,
in his lungs.
It lived in the spaces between words—
the ones he could never fill again.

Now all women smelled like wine.
But none
could make him drunk.
