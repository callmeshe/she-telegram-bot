Gastronomic Buddhism


Or: How to Stop Eating Yourself and Start Living
When the waiter placed the plate in front of her,
she already knew what would be there.
Herself.
It was a fine dining restaurant.
The wine was served like an elixir of immortality,
and waiters moved through the hall like ghosts in expensive shoes.
Everyone was eating. Everyone was beautiful. Everyone was hungry.
She looked down at herself from above —
miniature, like a figurine made of sugar glaze.
A doll laid out on pristine porcelain.
Black faux-fur jacket, long legs, sharp heels.
If someone played ominous music now,
the whole scene could pass as a metaphor for consumer society.
But no one played ominous music.
Your dish, mademoiselle, — said the waiter, offering her a silver knife.
She took it.
Soft jazz played in the background.
Someone laughed in the corner.
Life continued, while she stared at herself —
served on a plate.
We eat ourselves every day.
Slice by slice. Greedily.
Chewing without even tasting.
We’re carved up by our own expectations,
cut down by caffeine and deadlines.
Unlike Formula 1, there are no rules in this race —
just pure anarchy.
No one tells you when to slow down,
when to turn off,
when you’ve already crashed on the side of the road with a burned-out engine.
She lifted her gaze.
At the next table, a man in a Tom Ford suit carved his steak
like he’d personally killed the animal.
At the bar, a girl with billboard lips stirred her latte with caution.
They were eating themselves too.
Everyone was.
Some on a diet of criticism and self-loathing,
others fueled by fast dopamine —
coffee, shopping, likes, sex.
Anything to keep from feeling empty.
Because in this race, the hungry don’t last long.
She sighed, set the knife down, and picked up her champagne glass.
Then she pushed the plate away.
The music kept playing.
The man finished his steak.
The billboard girl raised her phone and snapped a shot of her latte.
The world kept devouring itself.
But she was no longer on the menu.
You’re not eating? — the waiter leaned in,
like a boa watching a mouse refuse the food chain.
I don’t eat myself anymore, — she said.
The waiter, with eyes like a nervous hamster,
looked at her cautiously —
as if she had just declared herself the reincarnation of Joe Dassin.
Then again, this place had seen worse.
All done? — the waiter clarified.
All done, — she nodded, pushing the plate aside.
A symbolic victory.
Small — but real.
In her world, built on dopamine hits and cognitive monsoons,
each day was an act of cannibalism.
She spooned up self-criticism,
chewed the sinews of you must do better,
swallowed chunks of you’re not enough.
She stepped outside and felt something shift inside her.
As if her stomach had finally rejected the taste of her old life.
The city was eating itself too.
Neon signs devoured the night.
24-hour restaurants swallowed people, chewed them up,
and spit them back out —
too drained to tell the difference between victory
and a marketing illusion.
Gastronomic Buddhism, — she muttered,
imagining a tomorrow where she’d stop feeding on herself.
Because in the end, enlightenment is simply realizing
you are not a meal on the system’s plate.
