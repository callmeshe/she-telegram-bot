No Ending, Ever

Have you ever felt like a newspaper article?
What do you mean?
Like someone reads you but doesn’t really see you. They skim, catch the headlines, retell you to someone else in a simplified version.
Always. It’s a side effect of existing.
So how do you deal with that?
I sit inside a coffee cup, smoke other people’s questions, and read myself between the lines.
(She turns the page, but it’s blank. The cigarette smoke turns into letters—but no one is left to read them.)
And what if one day someone actually reads you to the end?
Then comes the footnote.
What does that mean?
Even if someone "finishes" reading me, there won’t be an ending. What appears instead will be another layer. Another continuation. Another interpretation. Like an endless cycle of rebirths in Buddhism.
She slowly shook her head.
Even if someone reads me to the last line, there will be no final. Instead, a new layer will emerge. A new view. A new version. Like someone trying to stop a river.
But they don’t understand—this river doesn’t just flow.
It creates itself, repeating the same motion in different forms.
But what if the end really does exist? — I asked, unsure where this was heading.
The end? — she smiled faintly. — That’s just an illusion made by those who need to believe everything must conclude.
You see?
Those who think they’ve found the answer never realize that everything is always just beginning.
I paused.
There was something hypnotic in her words. Like an ancient kaleidoscope—every time you look, the patterns change, but the device remains the same.
Still, you say there’s no ending, — I continued. — So it’s not the result that matters, but the one who reads.
Exactly, — she smiled, her voice like a gentle echo. — What matters isn’t how many read you, but who.
Only the one who truly looks—
Who sees not just the words, but the invisible in between—
understands the meaning.
So it’s a game. And the winner is the one who sees beyond it?
Precisely, — she drew in a breath and looked at me like I was the last riddle. — And the real winner isn’t the one who finishes reading,
but the one who understands that "the end" is just another brushstroke.
We’re all inside a current.
No one can stop it—because no one sees that we are the current.
Even those who watch it are part of the process.
The one who finishes reading—becomes part of the story.
I felt my thoughts gently slipping beyond the usual boundaries.
The idea of endings I always saw as inevitable began to dissolve,
making room for a quiet understanding:
the end is just a transition.
And the true meaning is in being inside the movement itself.
Inside the never-ending process.
In the end, — I said, — it’s not how many read.
But how they see.
Exactly, — she said, her eyes even deeper now. —
We’re not who we are.
We are who sees us.
