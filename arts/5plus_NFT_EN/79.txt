BUT FIRST, COFFEE, DADDY

She entered his life like a lighter’s spark in a smoky bar.
Striped fur coat, red lips, a billion-dollar stare.
He was sipping espresso. She was sipping his energy.
Do you know why I’m here? — she asked, tracing her lips with lipstick.
— I suppose to tell me something important.
She leaned in, close enough for him to smell jasmine and unbearable confidence.
— You’re my coffee. Hot. Bitter. I drink you in slow sips.
He smiled.
— And you’re my poison. Dangerous by the dose, healing by the drop.
She stood, adjusted her stocking, and vanished without goodbye.
On the table, a receipt remained. Scribbled in red:
“But First, Coffee, Daddy.”
P.S. We’ve forgotten the taste of simple things. Touch. A drag.The wait before a call. Everything is too fast, too loud.
I leave room for naivety and cliché —
like the heat your skin remembers after a kiss.
Because love isn’t an idea.
It’s a voice at night.
And hands that know your body by heart.
