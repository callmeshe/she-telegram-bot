The File for the Higher Ones. The Novel That Wrote Me


Every morning she sat at her typewriter and spread her legs like a ballerina in rehearsal — perfectly, precisely. There was something ritualistic about it. Her hands placed the letters. Her legs held balance. And between them — a text growing through time and space.
She wrote about love, but never called it that.
She wrote about herself, but claimed it was fiction.
She described men who had become characters in her book — and realized they now belonged to her more than they ever belonged to themselves.
She wrote about the force that had accompanied her for a long time — silently, persistently.
About how it all resembled a therapy session, pulling the intangible from her depths and laying it down on paper.
Writing was like bloodletting — the more it poured out, the lighter her body became. With each text, she grew lighter. Smaller. More translucent.
A voice in her head whispered: "But who’s going to read this?"
She didn’t answer. The voice was wrong. She turned it down like she muted notifications from every app on her phone.
Every morning, the page received her doubts and turned them into reality.
One day, THAT VOICE woke up again.
You’re writing for one person, — it said. — But you don’t know who yet. Still, they’re already waiting.
She ran her finger along the smooth body of the machine and nodded.
Who are you? — she asked one day.
You already know, — the voice came from inside and outside her at once. Woven into the world around her. In the strangers’ conversations. In the comments under her texts.
But why now?
Because you finally opened the door.
She said nothing, feeling that strange mix of fear and awe rise within her.
Is it even normal to hear you?
Is it normal to write about what you've never said out loud?
She smirked.
People read. They say my words hit them directly.
Because they were never really yours. They lived inside you, but they belonged to everyone.
So it was you who made me write?
I just reminded you that you know how to speak.
She paused, remembering how she once didn’t believe her words could mean anything. But with every text, someone would always write: "This is about me."
So are you with me forever now?
I’ve always been here. You just used to drown me out with other voices.
And now?
Now, we speak.
