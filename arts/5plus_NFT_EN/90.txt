JOKER


(a novel about a kiss that trumps the deck)
On the table lay: a Rolex, prayer beads, three rings, playing cards. And a kiss. Not a real one — a lipstick mark. But it was the only thing that smelled like truth. He kept betting on the queen of spades. On currency. On luck. But each time, he won her. A woman with no suit. No status. Not even a name. Just — JOKER.
He thought he understood women. He knew jewelry, skin tones, gravitational pull. He knew the rules. But the joker doesn’t play by rules. She entered the game as if she didn’t care to win — just to reshuffle everything.
Got the time? — he asked.
Only now.
Got a name?
Only a trace.
He tried to hold her. But held only the illusion: just a card. And lips. Drawn. Too precise to be real.
He lost. Not the money. Not the round. He lost the certainty that he could ever figure her out. Because with her, it’s not the ones who place bets that win — it’s those who bet themselves.
P.S. Every man, at least once in life, should be dealt a joker. Just to learn: brand, money, status — it’s all a game. But the woman you can’t buy — she’s the only real prize.
