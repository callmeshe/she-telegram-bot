Tea Hole

Are you sure you want to try this? — the man asked, holding a small porcelain cup.
She nodded. He dipped a silver spoon with fine engraving into the liquid. On the handle, it said: “Drink me.”
Just don’t dive too deep, — he said, handing her the cup.
She took a sip.
The taste slid into her like a key into a lock. The world trembled slightly, and suddenly she felt like a drop in a hot ocean. Space contracted, turning inside out. Her body felt light, like a piece of paper folded into origami.
Are you alright? — his voice came from somewhere out there.
She nodded, but he was already gone. Only the dark void remained, and in it — a giant tea spoon.
A black ribbon with a tight knot dangled from its handle.
She tried to grab it, but the knot was slippery, like her own thoughts.
You were right, — a voice echoed.
About what?
The whole world is just a tea ceremony. The only thing that matters is who holds the spoon.
She laughed and jumped into the void.
