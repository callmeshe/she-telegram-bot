Ace on the Table. All or Nothing?


He had two passions — control and chaos.
The first showed in the way his cuff sat perfectly on his wrist.
The second — in the woman laughing, reclining against a stack of chips like the casino already belonged to her.
He always played big.
Even on Tinder.
"All or nothing," his bio read.
Cheap line? Maybe. But it worked.
On those craving danger.
On those who believed risk was worth it.
On those who wanted to stand at the epicenter of masculine fearlessness — even if they had to crawl out from the wreckage later.
She swiped right.
Now he was holding the card, and she — the glass.
All or nothing.
But what if both were the same?
All or nothing? — she asked, flipping a red chip into the air.
He turned the card over slowly.
Ace of hearts.
Play, or fold?
She already knew the answer.
You’re not a player. You’re a banker, — she smirked, melting into the shadows.
All he had left was to hold the card.
And realize his trump had already been played — by someone else.
