Udon Protocol™

He ordered noodles. Spicy. Like everything he’d been missing in life.
When the bowl arrived, it wasn’t just broth and udon inside — it was her. A woman in a red shirt, with one leg stretched above the limits of ordinary etiquette. She balanced on the noodles like karma, and the soy sauce in her eyes shimmered like the Bitcoin chart at peak pump.
Is this a mistake? — he asked.
It’s a contract, — she replied without breaking rhythm.
He picked up the chopsticks. Carefully. Not as utensils, but as an interface to something far more delicate. He tried to touch her. It didn’t work. She dodged — gracefully, like a candlestick chart: up, down, but never by the book.
Who are you?
I’m a craving you can’t chew through. Only live through.
He tried to eat the noodles. But each strand turned into a scene. She danced, twisted, quoted Buddhism and late-80s Japan. It was all too beautiful to be just food. Too intimate to be just art.
Why can’t I swallow you whole? — he asked.
Because taste isn’t about food. It’s about you.
He didn’t understand. And that was exactly right. The meaning wasn’t meant to be understood. Only to be savored.
When he finished, there was a note at the bottom of the bowl. In red calligraphy, it read:
Thank you for participating in Udon Protocol™
Next craving unlocks in 12 hours.”
He set the bowl aside.
And felt full.
But not satisfied.
