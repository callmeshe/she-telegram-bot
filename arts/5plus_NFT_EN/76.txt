Tea Ceremony

I woke up in tea. The sensation was strange: the liquid didn’t press on my body or interfere with breathing — it seeped through me, as if my thoughts had steeped along with the leaves. I lifted myself up and looked toward the rim of the cup. There he stood — like on a train platform — in a flawless suit, a silver spoon in hand.
— You’re here again, — he said, twirling the spoon between his fingers.
— Is this a dream?
— And what isn’t a dream nowadays?
I looked around. Beneath me were letters, written in thin, elegant handwriting, sealed with lipstick kisses. In one corner of the cup lay a tea tag — like an anchor holding me here.
— If you want, you can finish yourself and disappear, — he said, bringing the spoon to his lips.
I saw his fingers tremble. He knew I would choose. He always did.
— And what if I don’t want to disappear?
He smiled.
— Then stay. Let’s steep together.

P.S. And so she stayed.
"Let’s steep together."
