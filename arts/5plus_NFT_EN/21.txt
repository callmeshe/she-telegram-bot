A Glass Dream of Her

She appeared out of nowhere.
Just sat there on the rim of my whiskey, as if she’d always been there.
In a black polka dot dress, with a small handbag and slightly sad eyes, looking off to the side—past me, through me, into some private universe of her own.
I lifted the glass to my lips, but couldn’t bring myself to drink.
Have you been sitting there long? — I asked.
She shrugged, shifting one leg so that the hem of her dress rustled softly against the glass.
I guess I’ve always been here, — she said. — You just never looked.
I set the glass back down.
The ice inside chimed softly.
But you’re not real, are you? — I said.
She smiled. Slightly.
Ironically.
The way people do when they know something you don’t.
And what is real now? — she asked.
Outside the window, rain was falling.
And it felt like it wasn’t falling from the sky,
but from somewhere deep inside me.
Maybe you’re my longing, — I offered.
She looked at me more intently.
Or maybe you’re mine?
We fell silent.
At some point, I wondered:
If I drank this whiskey—would she vanish?
Or would she become part of me?
Are you afraid to drink me? — she asked suddenly.
I’m more afraid that if I do, you’ll stay with me forever, — I said.
She laughed.
Her laugh was light, like the clink of tiny glass ice shards.
Silly, — she said. — I’ve already stayed.
You just haven’t realized it yet.
And I knew she was right.
Outside, the rain kept falling.
And I sat, staring into my glass.
And in that glass sat a woman in a polka dot dress—
the very one I had once lost,
or maybe never found.
