The Abducted Aphrodite

She woke up because someone was lifting her. The world was muted, as if underwater, but within this muffled world, there was movement — smooth, unerring.
Her body was frozen in a strange pose: arms crossed, chest bare, the lower half wrapped in something heavy — velvet? Or silk? She couldn’t move. Couldn’t even move her lips to ask, “What’s happening?”
Through the fine digital haze of reality emerged a hand in a white glove. Strong. Precise. It held a silver tray — and on it, there she was. Naked. But weightless.
— Exquisite, — said a voice off-screen. — Exclusive, — replied another.
Somewhere far away, a stock ticker was clicking. And an inverted Rolex ticked on. Eternity had found its price.
She realized: she was being served. Maybe to a new collector. Maybe — to the Gods.
She couldn’t scream. But a thought rang like glass:
“I’m so tired of auctions. Of bids, of lots, of eyes that devour. Of endless transactions. I want just one thing — someone who dares. Someone who bids with the heart. No bargaining. No manipulation. No pool expectations. Just — because he feels it.”
