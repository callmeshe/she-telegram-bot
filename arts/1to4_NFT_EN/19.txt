Espresso with a Hint of Woman

  He used to think antidepressants came in pill form. Until he tried her.
  She appeared somewhere between his second and third sip of espresso, leaning over the cup as if diving into it. Her slender fingers brushed along the porcelain rim, and for a moment, the coffee seemed to shiver. He blinked—she was gone.
  Since then, he drank only espresso. In every cup, he searched for the trace of her skin. In every sip, he chased the aftertaste of her words. The barista at his favorite café once asked, “You never add sugar?”
  Sugar wasn’t needed. Each cup held her presence—dark, thick, bitter in just the right way.
  Sometimes he believed that if he drank enough coffee, he might see her again. Or at least, revisit the state she’d left him in.
