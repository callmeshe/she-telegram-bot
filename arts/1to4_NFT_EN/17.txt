The Bachelor Set

She woke up in a shirt.
Not in the sense that she put on his shirt—she literally woke up inside it. Crisp white fabric. Stiff collar. A tie. Neatly placed shoes at the foot of the bed. Last night, he seemed like a man. This morning—he was just a perfectly assembled set.
— Is this a dream? — she murmured, touching a kiss left by herself. 

Not in the sense that she wore his shirt—she had become it. The sheets still carried the aftertaste of last night. The air held something elusive—the scent of other women’s perfume, the trace of old kisses, shadows of those who had once been here, and long since dissolved into the atmosphere. 

His bachelor’s lair was sterile-perfect, like a magazine spread. Every object held just enough soul to create the illusion of warmth—never enough to let it take root. A bar where each bottle knew its place. A couch that remembered more stories than its owner. Mirrors that reflected everyone who came in—but never held on to anyone.

It was the bachelor’s ultimatum: minimal furniture, maximum space. Carefully curated aromas of former lovers. A bathroom that still smelled of someone else’s shampoo. A Buddha watching her with detached knowing, as if aware that this had happened before. With her. With others. With him.

She stood up and wrapped herself in the shirt—his shirt—which, somehow, fit too well, like it had been tailored to her. In the mirror flashed a reflection—not hers, but something greater. Not a museum. Not a graveyard. More like an anatomical theatre of personalities who had once been here but never belonged.

She slid barefoot across the floor, a silk shadow flickering in the mirror. Maybe the wind. Maybe a memory. Or a spirit—fed by the pheromones of departing lovers.
In the bathroom, on the snow-white sink, lay a dark red lipstick. 
She picked it up, twisted the tube, and traced a line across her lips out of habit. The reflection shifted. The penthouse was no longer empty. Now—it was watching her.
— Who are you here? — she asked the silence.
And the house, it seemed, replied:
— The one who stayed.
This was a place where women stayed the night, but never stayed for the morning. But it held her differently. She could feel something invisible embracing her. The pillow knew the shape of her head. The blanket pressed to her like a pair of caring arms. Even the sunlight, breaking through the panoramic windows, touched her skin tenderly.
She closed her eyes. Just for a moment. To exhale.
And suddenly she knew— this place, its cold perfection, the sterile walls, the silent Buddha— they wouldn’t let her go. Not because they loved her. But because they recognized her.
Everything here was calculated: the aromas, the reflections, even the memory—in precise doses.
But she broke the formula. She stayed. Not in body. But in soul. And that changed the entire code.
