Gastronomy of the Pointless

His business lunch started somewhat unusually. First, the pasta on his plate was moving. Second, in the center of it, a girl was writhing.

She was shrimp-sized—thin, flexible, with a small chest and sharp collarbones. Her body seemed woven from fine, stretched threads of energy—elusive, yet wildly magnetic. There was something defiant in the curve of her back, and in the motion of her arms—a careless precision, like that of a dancer improvising yet always hitting the rhythm.

— Your special dish, — said the waitress, who looked like a retouched magazine cover, as she placed a silver utensil set in front of him and tilted her head slightly.

— Is this AI-generated?

— It’s 100% organic, sir.

He picked up the fork, twirled the spaghetti, and lifted it. The girl stretched languidly, as if enjoying the touch of metal. He gently shook a tiny pepper grinder, sprinkling her bare shoulder with black dots of spice.

— Eat me, — she whispered.

He bit in slowly. The taste was... different. Not like the usual pasta. Not like fine delicacies. Not like cheap pleasures. Deep. Complex. With a salty bitterness on the tongue.

This wasn’t the kind of dish you could eat quickly, washing it down with wine. It called for something else. To feel the texture. Unfold the aftertaste. Try to understand. But he didn’t.

After a bite, he spit her back onto the plate and motioned to the waitress.

— Can I get another one?

She nodded silently and disappeared into the depths of the restaurant. A minute later, a new plate appeared. New pasta. New girl.

He bit again. And again.
And again—and again.
And again—and again.
And again—and again.

But her taste stayed inside him forever.
