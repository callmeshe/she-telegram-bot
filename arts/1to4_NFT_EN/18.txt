The Woman in the Frame

When they brought the painting in, I knew immediately—something was wrong.
First of all, they were holding it in white gloves, like a sacred relic, even though the frame was cheap gilded linden from IKEA.
Second — She was inside it.
Not painted, not photographed—alive, in a black dress, wearing the kind of expression you only see on someone suddenly trapped between two worlds.
— It’s the newest simulacrum, — said the gallery director, gently wiping his glasses and winking at me, as if we were discussing not a woman, but a refrigerator with a built-in teleporter. — It’s called The Impossible Muse. Hand-crafted. One of a kind.
I stepped closer.
She looked at me like she wanted to say something, but her lips didn’t move.
— How did she get in there? — I asked, though I already knew there would be no answer.
— You don’t understand, — the director smiled. — This isn’t a woman in a painting. It’s a painting that’s become a woman.
I smirked.
Pelevin would’ve approved.
— And what do you do with her? — I asked, studying the contours of her body, lost in the hyperreality of the pose.
— You look. Contemplate. Suffer. She fills the emptiness. And, by the way—sells very well.
For a moment, I thought she blinked. Or maybe the light just shifted?
— What if she steps out of the frame? — I asked.
— Impossible, — said the director, then after a pause, his voice dropping—
— Though… sometimes, at night, she tries.
He turned to the other guests, and I was left alone with her eyes.
— Do you want to get out? — I asked silently.

She gave a slight nod.
Or did she?

And that’s when I knew: if I bought her, if I brought her home—this painting would start growing, like an iceberg beneath the surface, until one day I’d find myself inside it.
And who knows who’d be standing outside, looking in?

Maybe I’m already part of another painting, I thought, and suddenly I felt afraid. But of course, I gave the director a silent nod. And when they politely asked where the painting should be delivered, I said—
— Straight to the bedroom. So every morning it can remind me which one of us is real.
And as they carried her out, I could’ve sworn — she smiled.
