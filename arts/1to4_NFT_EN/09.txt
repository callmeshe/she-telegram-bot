Polaroid Muse

She came to me in a dream — or maybe I came to her. Everything had that grainy texture, like old film, and the air smelled faintly of developer.
A woman in glasses, layered skirt sweeping the floor, leaned on a massive camera like it was a motorcycle.
— Who are you? I asked.
— The aperture between worlds, she said, lazily turning the shutter dial. — I’ll adjust the light. Then you’ll see what’s hidden.
I looked into the lens.
Inside was a pit.
Black.
Bottomless.
— Is that… emptiness?
She nodded.
— You want me to jump?
— You’re already in.

I felt it pulling me — not a fall, but a dissolve.
And in that last flicker before vanishing,
I saw her press the shutter.

Click.

I woke in my room.
On the nightstand, a black-and-white photograph:
me, standing on the edge of the abyss, smiling — like someone who finally understood.
