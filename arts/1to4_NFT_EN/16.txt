The Steeping

She waited.
Years folded into dense layers of bitterness, infusing her like aged sheng pu-erh, matured in the dark, until its time would come.

But around her, everyone drank teabags. Light, watery, disposable. Thrown into boiling water, stirred with a spoon, squeezed until no flavor was left.

She waited for someone who wouldn’t rush.
Someone who would unwrap her gently, inhale her scent.
Someone who would notice the texture of the leaf, warm the gaiwan, discard the first pour—and only then, begin.

Time passed.
Someone said, “You’re too complicated. Just steep already.”
Someone joked, “Darling, teabags are just easier.”

Teapots stood in their usual places, thin porcelain cups chimed softly on tables. Everything was proper, measured, like in English tradition—a dash of milk, exactly three minutes.
But the tea turned out bland, shallow.
Leaving only a polite kind of emptiness behind, as cold as the small talk shared over it.

She waited for someone who would steep her right.
Someone who knew good tea doesn’t tolerate haste.
That it must be felt.
Given time to unfold.
Someone who understood the worth of patience, the strength of time.
Someone who could read between the leaves.

And then one day—he came.
And everything changed.

He didn’t rush.
Didn’t fidget.
Didn’t drown her in boiling water.
He simply sat across from her, looked into her—and waited.
He poured the water in a thin stream, not destroying, but revealing.

From the very first moment, she knew—
he knew what he was doing.

And then she understood—
this was the perfect steep.
