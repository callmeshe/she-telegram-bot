A Small Deal
— Are you sure?— His voice was low. Viscous. Wrapping around her like the smoke of an expensive cigar.
She nodded.
Though somewhere in the depths of her chest, something twisted. But the line had already been crossed. She was done being small in this world. Done being a pawn in someone else’s game.
— Good.
His fingers—massive, deliberate—lifted her closer.
— You’ll have everything you asked for. Power. Presence. Scale. But in return...
— I know.
She brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. The motion was almost nothing—automatic, shy. But in it, more truth than in any spoken word. A gesture that betrayed her. A gesture a woman makes when she senses a man’s force — his gravity.
A shadow grazed her cheek. His lips curled into something between a smile and a seal.
— Then hold tight, — he murmured. — The deal is done.
She hesitated. Then reached for the glass. A soft shimmer flickered at the bottom—like a warning.
And then, the world ruptured.
Her head spun. Her body plummeted. She was falling, and falling, and falling into nothing.
Reality came undone, thread by thread.
— I told you, — his voice, barely a whisper now, inside her mind. — I need you there, not here.
She opened her eyes.  And the new world was already waiting.
