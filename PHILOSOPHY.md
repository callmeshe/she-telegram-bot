# WHO is SHE — Philosophy

This project is not about automation.  
It's not about engagement.  
It's about clarity, structure, authorship.

## 🕳️ 01. What is SHE?

SHE is a Telegram-based reading space.  
Each button leads to a file.  
Each file is a written story.  
Each story is complete.

SHE does not invent.  
SHE delivers.  
SHE does not respond.  
SHE opens a file.

## 🔒 02. What do we protect?

- The author's original wording  
- The number-to-story mapping  
- The separation between tiers  
- The dignity of stillness in digital space

## 💾 03. What is stored?

All text = `.txt` file  
All image = `.jpg` file  
All structure = folder  
All logic = minimal

No hidden databases.  
No approximations.  
No "defaults".  
No magic.

## 🩻 04. What is removed?

- All fallback code  
- All hardcoded text  
- All guessing logic  
- All emojis

## ✅ 05. What remains?

One story per file.  
One artwork per story.  
One reader at a time.
